# INTRODUCTION

`r sp` (*Atheresthes stomias*, Family Pleuronectidae), also commonly called Turbot, is a species of flatfsh that occurs in the offshore waters of British Columbia. `r sp` are primarily taken by the groundfsh bottom trawl fishery, although they are also encountered by hook and line fisheries, particularly those targeting Pacifc Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*). Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers in the British Columbia groundfish fleet in the mid-2000s, most of the historical catch of `r sp` is understood to have been discarded at sea. Proteolysis occurs in the muscle tissue of this species a short time after it is caught, making the flesh mushy and unpalatable. In the past five years, Asian markets have been established for fillets that have been frozen at sea as soon as possible after capture to reduce proteolysis. There is also an Asian market for the frills. The stock was last assessed by @grandin2017, who presented an age-structured Bayesian model using the iSCAM platform. This stock assessment covers the combined Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD and 5ABCDE off the west coast of British Columbia.
