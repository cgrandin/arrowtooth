# Introduction

`r sp` (*Atheresthes stomias*, Family Pleuronectidae), also commonly called Turbot, is a species of flatfsh that occurs in the offshore waters of `r bc`. `r sp` are primarily taken by the groundfsh bottom trawl fishery, although they are also encountered by hook and line fisheries, particularly those targeting Pacifc Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*). Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers in the `r bc` groundfish fleet in the mid-2000s, most of the historical catch of `r sp` is understood to have been discarded at sea. Proteolysis occurs in the muscle tissue of this species a short time after it is caught, making the flesh mushy and unpalatable. In the past five years, Asian markets have been established for fillets that have been frozen at sea as soon as possible after capture to reduce proteolysis. There is also an Asian market for the frills. The stock was last assessed by @grandin2017, who presented an age-structured Bayesian model using the iSCAM platform. This stock assessment covers the combined Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD and 5ABCDE off the west coast of `r bc`.

## Purpose of document

`r sp` is managed as a coastwide stock in `r bc`, with the majority of the catch coming from Pacifc Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD; `r wcvi`, 5AB; `r qcs` and 5CD; `r hs` (Figures XX and XX, Table XX). The Strait of Georgia (management area 4B) is not included in this stock assessment. The 2020 Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was 4,000 metric tonnes, reduced from 15,000 t in March of 2020.

The purpose of this stock assessment is to update management advice for `r sp` stocks in `r bc`, as requested by the Pacifc Groundfsh Management Unit (GMU). This assessment identifes reference points for `r sp` that are consistent with the DFO Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach [@dfo2009] and characterizes stock status relative to these reference points, using a Bayesian, age-structured stock assessment model. Management advice is provided in the form of decision tables which forecast the impacts of a range of harvest levels on `r sp` stock status relative to these reference points.
