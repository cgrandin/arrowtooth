### Base Model {#decisions-base}

Performance measureswere calculated overa sequence of alternative `r end_yr` projected catch levels and are based on one-year projections to `r proj_yr`. Projected, bias-corrected log recruitment anomalies in `r end_yr` and `r proj_yr` were drawn randomly from a normal distribution, $~N(0,\tau)$.

Median (and 95% credibility interval) posterior estimates of reference points (MSY and $B_0$-based reference points) and benchmarks(B1996, B2015, F2014)were providedinTable6. Decision tables are presented showing predicted probabilities of undesirable states under alternative 2015 projected catch levels.
