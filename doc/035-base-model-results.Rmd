cat("### Model diagnostics {#scam-model-diag}
The joint posterior distribution was numerically approximated using the Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm in AD Model Builder [@fournier2012]. For the base model and all sensitivity cases, posterior samples were drawn every `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)` iterations from a chain of length `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, resulting in `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` posterior samples (of which the first `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` were dropped as burn-in). Convergence was diagnosed using visual inspection of the traceplots (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-trace) and \@ref(fig:fig-base-trace-selex)) and examination of autocorrelation in posterior chains (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-autocor) and \@ref(fig:fig-base-autocor-selex)). Autocorrelation was low at lag values up to 1,000 for all parameters after thinning. Correlation between parameters appeared low overall, with only some moderate correlations between catchability parameters and $\bar{R}$ (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-pairs) and \@ref(fig:fig-base-pairs-sel)). There was no strong evidence for lack of convergence in the base model.

cat("### Fits to Data {#scam-data-fits}
The model generally fit the indices of abundance well (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)). The `r wcvis` has a large fluctuation high and low for successive years of the survey from 2008--2016, which is difficult for the model to fit. The `r qcs` was difficult to fit, due to fluctuations from high to low abundance from year to year early in the time series, and the lack of the recent drop in biomass seen in all other data sources. A sensitivity was done to attempt a better fit on this index, while retaining the good fits on the others (Section \@ref(sens-qcs-tv)). 

The `r dcpue` fit particularly well and is the only index to have a value for every year in the assessment. Standardized residuals show mostly even distribution of positive and negative residuals, with evidence of some autocorrelation in the `r dcpue` residuals (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-resids)). For all indices, the log index residuals (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-resids)) were good, with all being in the [-2, 2] range.

Fits to age compositions for each gear, and log standardized residuals are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-age-fits-ft)--\@ref(fig:fig-base-age-resids-wcvis). Fits were reasonable and there were no strong patterns in the residuals.

Prior and posterior probability distributions of estimated parameters are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts). The median and 95% CI (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) posterior parameter estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:param-estimates-table). With the exception of steepness, the posterior estimates did not appear to be strongly influenced by the prior probability distributions. The posterior probability distribution for steepness, $h$, was similar to the prior distribution, suggesting that there was little information about this parameter in the data. Sensitivity to the assumed prior for steepness is tested in Section \@ref(sens-h). 

Normal prior probability distributions were used for the log catchability parameters $\ln(q_k)$ for the indices of abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts)). Posterior estimates tended to overlap with the left-hand tail of the prior distributions for each index. Sensitivity analyses (discussed in Section \@ref(sens-analyses)) indicated that posterior estimates of catchability were sensitive to the mean and standard deviation of the prior distribution.

cat("### Selectivity {#selex}
Selectivity-at-age was estimated for the two fisheries and the synoptic surveys (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)). The `r dcpue` and `r hsmas` fixed selectivities are also shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex).

Posterior estimates of age-at-50%-harvest ($\hat{a}_k$) and the standard deviation in the logistic selectivity ogive ($\hat{\gamma}_k$) are provided in Table \@ref(tab:param-estimates-table). The median posterior estimates of age-at-50%-harvest were higher for females than males for all gears except for the `r hss`, which had a higher estimate for males. The estimates of standard deviation were similar between sexes by gear.

These estimates were further to the right than expected, but were consistent with the available age composition data (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ages)), which indicate fewer observations of younger fish, especially in the latter part of the timeseries. Numerous tests of alternative model configurations did not result in a lower estimate of age-at-50%-harvest for any gear/sex combination.

`r sp` are thought to mature at around `r f(base_model$dat$age.at.50.mat[1], 1)` years of age for females and `r f(base_model$dat$age.at.50.mat[2], 1)` years of age for males (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-mat), Table \@ref(tab:growth-params-table)). Therefore, it appears that individuals have several opportunities to spawn before they become vulnerable to the fishery. This in turn resulted in estimates of maximum sustainable harvest rate $U_\mathrm{MSY}$ approaching 1 (discussed in Section \@ref(fishery-ref-points)), implying that under theoretical equilibrium conditions, all of the vulnerable (i.e., fully selected) biomass could be harvested because the population could be sustained by younger spawners that are invulnerable to the fishery. This is a theoretical condition subject to the assumptions in the stock assessment model and the data limitations therein. We strongly advise against this as a harvest strategy and suggest that the age-at-50% selectivity in the commercial trawl fleets are a primary axis of uncertainty in this stock assessment.")

cat("### Fishery Reference Points {#fishery-ref-points}
Posterior estimates of fishery reference points from the base model are provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-ref-points). The posterior unfished spawning biomass ($SB_0$) (abbreviated to $B_0$ herein) had a median `r f(ref_pts$sbo[2] * 1000)` t and 95% CI ranging from `r f(ref_pts$sbo[1] * 1000)` t to `r f(ref_pts$sbo[3] * 1000)` t (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). Posterior 95% CIs for the LRP $0.2B_0$ and USR $0.4B_0$ are also provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table).

Reference points based on maximum sustainable yield MSY were strongly impacted by estimates of selectivity in the trawl fisheries described in the previous section. Because the selectivity ogives were estimated to the right of the maturity ogive, the median estimates of $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ were `r f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet1[2], 2)` for the Freezer trawler fleet and `r f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet2[2], 2)` for the Shoreside fleet (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). The CI on these values is large, `r paste0(f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet1[1], 2), "-", f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet1[3], 2))` for the `r base_model$dat$fleet_gear_names[1]` fleet and `r paste0(f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet2[1], 2), "-", f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet2[3], 2))` for the `r base_model$dat$fleet_gear_names[2]` fleet. These instantaneous fishing mortalities convert to an annual harvest rate approaching 1 for the Shoreside fleet  (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-ref-points)), through the equation $U_\mathrm{MSY} = 1-e^{F_\mathrm{MSY}}$, implying that all of the vulnerable biomass (i.e., the biomass that is selected by the fishing gear) could be harvested because the population can be sustained by the spawning biomass that is invulnerable to the fishery (i.e., fish that are between `r f(base_model$dat$age.at.50.mat[1], 1)` and `r f(mean_female_age_50_sel, 1)` years for females and `r f(base_model$dat$age.at.50.mat[2], 1)` and `r f(mean_male_age_50_sel, 1)` for males). The relationship between age at maturity and age at first harvest and its effect on fishery reference points was discussed by @myers1998, who described a fishing strategy where overfishing could be avoided by allowing all fish to spawn before they were available to be caught. @froese2004 also discusses reduction in risks of overfishing by allowing fish to spawn before they are caught.

It is important to understand the distinction between vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass. The fishery reference points $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ and $U_\mathrm{MSY}$ refer to catch of the vulnerable biomass $VB_t$, which is determined by the selectivity function
\begin{equation} 
  VB_{t,k} = \sum_{a} N_{a,t} w_{a,t} v_{a,t,k},
(\#eq:vuln-biomass)
\end{equation} 
where $a$ is age, $t$ is year, $k$ is the trawl fishery (Freezer trawlers or Shoreside), $N$ is the population number, $w$ is the average weight-at-age, and $v$ is the vulnerability-at-age in the trawl fisheries (i.e., selectivity).

When the selectivity ogive is located to the right of the maturity ogive, this means that a larger proportion of the total population is mature than vulnerable to the fishery (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb-vuln-compare)). A comparison between vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass is provided in Section \@ref(scam-biomass).

The median posterior estimate of $B_\mathrm{MSY}$ (and 95% CI), conditional on estimated trawl selectivities and resulting $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ values, was `r f(ref_pts$bmsy[2] * 1000)` t (`r f(ref_pts$bmsy[1] * 1000)`--`r f(ref_pts$bmsy[3] * 1000)`) (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). Posterior CIs for the default LRP $0.4B_\mathrm{MSY}$ and USR $0.8B_\mathrm{MSY}$ are also provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table). The $B_0$-based LRP and USR were approximately four times as large as the $B_\mathrm{MSY}$-based reference points. I.e., $B_0$-based reference points were more precautionary than the $B_\mathrm{MSY}$-based reference points (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)).")

cat("### Biomass {#scam-biomass}
The base model estimates the spawning biomass to have been on a decreasing trajectory since 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb), Table \@ref(tab:biomass-table)). The posterior median (and 95% CI) spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is projected to be `r f(proj_bio[2] * 1000)` t (`r f(proj_bio[1] * 1000)`--`r f(proj_bio[3] * 1000)`) (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). The median projected beginning-of-year `r assess_yr` spawning biomass, which incorporates fishing mortality arising from the observed `r end_yr` catch, is considerably higher than median estimates of both the default USR of $0.8B_\mathrm{MSY}$ and the default LRP of $0.4B_\mathrm{MSY}$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb), Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). The `r assess_yr` spawning biomass was projected to be slightly below the USR $0.4B_0$ and above the LRP $0.2B_0$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-depletion), Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)).

For comparison, posterior estimates of vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass are shown together in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb-vuln-compare). The two estimated vulnerable biomasses are considerably smaller than the spawning biomass, due to the relatively early age at maturity compared to the estimated age-at-50%-harvest, discussed in Sections \@ref(scam-ref-points) and \@ref(fishery-ref-points).")

Projected recruitment anomalies for 2021 and 2022 were drawn randomly from a normal distribution, $N(0, \tau^2)$.
