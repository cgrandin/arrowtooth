# Bridging analysis

The base model from the 2015 assessment was run with the newest version of the iSCAM code and the original data files and the results were determined to be identical.

Various modifications were made incrementally to create a set of *bridging models* which evaluate the component-specific effects of all changes from the 2015 base model to the 2021 base model.

As a reminder, the 2015 base model was a female-only statistical-catch-at-age model with 4 indices of abundance which included the three Synoptic surveys and the Hecate Strait Multispecies assemblage survey.

The bridging models were constructed as follows:

1. Extracted the data used in the 2015 model using the **gfplot** package, which has been used in several assessments and in the **gfsynopsis** report. Ran the 2015 model without any modifications other than this data change.

1. Used the same data extraction methods as in the first model, appended data up to and including 2019.

1. Attempted to add the West Coast Haida Gwaii Synoptic survey (WCHGSS) but the model fails to estimate trawl selectivity when both the Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage survey (HSMAS) and the WCHGSS are included, so the WCHGSS was left out due to its limited area and years of coverage and because the HSMAS covers the early period of the time series.

1. Added the Discard CPUE index. This was suggested by the Technical Working Group (TWG) and is an index of vessels that were not fishing for `r sp` and therefore discarding all that they caught incidentally. This index is described in greater detail in later sections.

1. Converted the model to have a split-sex age structure. The TWG agreed that calculation of proportions female to be multiplied by catch and index values was not robust enough and that given the sexual dimorphism of the species a split-sex model should be used. A more detailed description of the split-sex model is found in later sections.

1. Changed the fishing year to be from January 1 - December 31 to the current management period which is Feb. 21 - Feb. 20. All catch and commercial age-compositions were modified and re-weighted.

A comparison of MPD spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass) and \@ref(fig:bridge-relative-biomass). Index fits for each bridge model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-index-fits). The Discard CPUE and HSSS are influencing the estimates heavily, with the final model fitting quite well to the most recent portion of those indices. The fishing year has a large scaling effect on the Discard CPUE fit, due to it being based on the vessels' actual fishing season.

The final model on this list, which is split-sex and has the fishing year set to Feb. 21 - Feb. 20 is considered the base model for this assessment.
