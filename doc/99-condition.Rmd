# TRENDS IN BODY CONDITION

We investigated spatiotemporal patterns in `r sp` body condition [@nash2006a] with body condition (hereafter 'condition') indexing the 'plumpness' of an organism.
We do so by fitting a coastwide geostatistical  model to the residuals from the `r sp` length-weight relationship following other recent approaches [@thorson2015condition; @lindmark2022].

## CONDITION MODEL

We first fit a non-spatial length-weight model of the form $\log (W_i) \sim$ Student-t $(\mathrm{df} = 3, \log(a) + b \log(L_i), \sigma),$ with $W_i$ and $L_i$ representing the weight and length for fish $i$ and $\sigma$ representing the observation error scale. The degrees of freedom (df) of the Student-t distribution is set to 3 to be robust to outliers. The variables $a$ and $b$ represent the estimated length-weight parameters.
We fit these separately for male and female fish.

We then calculated condition factor $K^\mathrm{cond}$ as $W_i / \widehat{W}_i$ where $\widehat{W}_i$ refers to the predicted weight from the above weight-length model.
We removed condition factor values that were greater than the 0.995 quantile or less than the 0.005 quantile to lessen the effect of outliers.

We then fit a geostatistical model following the methods in Appendix \@ref(app:geostat).
Our model was of the form

\begin{align}
K^\mathrm{cond}_{s,t} &\sim \operatorname{Lognormal} \left(\mu^\mathrm{cond}_{s,t}, \sigma^\mathrm{cond} \right),\\
\mu^\mathrm{cond}_{s,t} &= \exp \left(\beta_0 + f (d_{s,t}) + \delta_{s,t} \right).
\end{align}

Here, $\beta_0$ is a global intercept, $f (d_{s,t})$ is a penalized smoother for depth, and $\delta_{s,t}$ represents a spatiotemporal random field that follows a random walk

\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\delta}_{t=1} &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} (\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}),\\
\boldsymbol{\delta}_{t>1} &= \boldsymbol{\delta}_{t-1} +  \boldsymbol{\epsilon_{t-1}},  \:
\boldsymbol{\epsilon_{t-1}} \sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} \right).
\end{align}

We considered a model that included a spatial random field; however, the variance of this random field was estimated near zero and so we excluded it in our final model.
We then calculated an annual condition-factor index as the average predicted $K^\mathrm{cond}_{s,t}$ across all survey 4 km $\times$ 4 km grid cells each year.

## CONDITION RESULTS

Our modeling reveals an overall decline in coastwide body condition from around 2004 until 2012, an increase until 2015, and a subsequent decline in recent years leveling off since 2019 (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-index-en)).
However, when split up by survey, we see that this overall trend masks differences that we see along the coast (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-index-surv-en)).
Condition within SYN WCVI has been declining since around 2015, but condition in other survey regions has remained relatively stable in those years (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-index-surv-en)).
Furthermore, the coastwide index trend of an increase from 2012 to 2015 was driven largely by SYN QCS (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-index-surv-en)).
We can also see these trends when looking at the spatial predictions through time (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-map-en)).
The depth smoother indicates a higher condition factor in deeper waters (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-smoother-en)), which coincides with a higher condition factor in SYN WCHG, which covers deeper regions than the other surveys.
