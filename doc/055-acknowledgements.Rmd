cat("# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank members of the `r sp` Technical Working Group (Robyn Forrest, Rowan Haigh, Paul Starr, Diedre Finn, Rob Tadey, Bruce Turris, and Brian Mose) for their valuable advice and insights throughout this project. We thank members of the Sclerochronology Laboratory at the Pacifc Biological Station for their processing of `r sp` otoliths.

We thank the reviewers for their careful reviews, which uncovered structural issues that would have otherwise been missed. This highlights the importance of independent peer review in the advisory process.

We thank participants of the CSAS review meeting which took place on Oct. 19--20, 2022 for their studious and thoughtful comments and requests. Thanks to Shannon Obradovich for chairing the meeting.
