cat("## STATISTICAL CATCH-AT-AGE MODEL {#scam-model}
### Model Description {#scam-model-desc}

A two-sex, Bayesian statistical catch-at-age model was applied to assess the coastwide stock status of `r sp`. The model is based on the Integrated Statistical Catch Age Model (`r iscam`) framework, @martell2011. Full model details are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc).

We define a base model with fixed and estimated parameters described in Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table). A total of `r num_params` model parameters were estimated by the base model (Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table) shows some of these). The model estimated time series of log recruitment anomalies and log fishing mortality rates; and time-invariant values of unfished recruitment, steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship, natural mortality, average recruitment, and logistic selectivity parameters for the two commercial fisheries and the four synoptic surveys. Prior probability distributions for the base model are shown in Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts) and described in Section \@ref(scam-model-priors). Model sensitivity to fixed parameters and to assumed prior probability distributions are presented in Section \@ref(sens-analyses).

The model was conditioned on observed catch data (`r ct_start_yr`--`r ct_end_yr`), which were assumed to be known without error. The model was fit to five survey indices of abundance, the Discard CPUE index, and to age composition data from the two commercial fisheries, and the four synoptic surveys. Biological parameters determining weight-at-age and maturity-at-age schedules were estimated independently (Appendix \@ref(app:bio-data-appendix)) and input into the assessment model as fixed parameters that remained constant over time.

Survey biomass indices were treated as relative abundance indices that are directly proportional to the survey vulnerable biomass at the beginning of each year. Observation errors in relative abundance indices were assumed to be log-normally distributed. The catchability parameter $q_k$ was estimated for each index $k$. Prior probability distributions for $\ln(q_k)$ are described in Section \@ref(sec:scam-priors-en).

Age-composition observations were assumed drawn from a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. No age-reading errors were assumed.

Selectivity-at-age for the trawl fisheries, five surveys, and Discard CPUE index was modelled using a two-parameter logistic function with asymptote at 1. Age-at-50%-vulnerability ($\hat{a}_k$) and the standard deviation of the logistic selectivity curve ($\hat{\gamma}_k$) for each gear $k$ were estimated for the trawl fisheries and the synoptic surveys. No age composition data were available for the `r hsmas` and `r dcpue` so selectivity was fixed with $\hat{a}_k = 9$ and $\hat{\gamma}_k = 1.5$, similar to estimated values for the other gears. Sensitivity runs (not included in this document) indicated that there was little model sensitivity to this assumption.

Variance components of the model were partitioned into observation and process errors. The key variance parameter is the inverse of the total variance (i.e., $\vartheta^2$, total precision). The total variance is partitioned into observation and process error components by the model parameter $\rho$, which represents the proportion of the total variance that is due to observation error (@punt1999; @deriso2007). The total variance is partitioned into observation errors ($\sigma$) and process errors ($\tau$) using Eq. \@ref(eq:df17) from Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc). The parameters $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were fixed in the current assessment (Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table)) at values that gave $\sigma = 0.2$ and $\tau = 0.8$. See Section \@ref(sens-sigma) for sensitivity analyses to this assumption. See Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc) for further details on the treatment of variance in this assessment.")

cat("### Prior Probability Distributions {#scam-model-priors}

Prior probability distributions for the base model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts) and Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table). Model sensitivities to assumed prior distributions are presented in Sections \@ref(sens-sigma), \@ref(sens-m), and \@ref(sens-q).

Uniform prior probability distributions were assumed for $\ln(R_0)$, $\ln(\bar{R})$, $\ln(R_\mathrm{init})$ and selectivity parameters (Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table)). A Beta distribution was assumed for the steepness ($h$) of the stock-recruit relationship, with shape parameters that resulted in a distribution with mean = `r f(base_h_prior1, 2)` and CV = `r f(base_h_prior2, 2)` (Beta($\alpha$ = `r f(base_h$p1, 1)`, $\beta$ = `r f(base_h_prior2, 1)`)). This prior was based on a literature review on steepness parameters for Pacific flatfish species done by @holt2016 and was used in the `r la` for `r sp`. A review of steepness estimates for flatfish species by @maunder2012 suggested that flatfish steepness using a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship may be around $0.94$ (where $h$ approaching $1.0$ implies recruitment is independent of spawning biomass).

A normal distribution was assumed for $\ln(M)$ for both sexes with mean = $\ln$(`r f(exp(base_m_female$p1), 2)`) and SD = `r f(exp(base_m_female$p2), 2)` for females and mean = $\ln$(`r f(exp(base_m_male$p1), 2)`) and SD = `r f(exp(base_m_male$p2), 2)` for males (in log space). @holt2016 reviewed the literature and stock assessments and assumed a prior probability distribution for M with mean = $0.2$ in their assessment of British Columbia Rock Sole (*Lepidopsetta spp.*). @goa2021 assumed a value of M = $0.35$ for males and M = $0.2$ for females in the assessment of Gulf of Alaska Arrowtooth Flounder, as well as for the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands stock [@bering2019].

Normal prior probability distributions were assumed for the log survey catchability parameters $\ln(q_k)$ for each survey $k$. Normal distributions with mean = $\ln$(`r base_qk_mean`) and SD = `r base_qk_sd` in log space were selected because the survey estimates of biomass were derived from swept area analysis (Eqs. \@ref(eq:swept-area), \@ref(eq:cpue-density), and \@ref(eq:survey-biomass-variance)) and could therefore reasonably be expected to be within 1â€“2 orders of magnitude of unity. A large standard deviation was used to reflect ignorance of the scale of the swept area analysis compared with the true biomass.")

cat("### Fishery Reference Points {#scam-ref-points}

The DFO Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (PA) policy [@dfo2009] requires stock status to be characterized using three reference points:

1. A Reference Removal Rate
1. An Upper Stock Reference point (USR)
1. A Limit Reference Point (LRP)

Provisional values of USR = $0.8B_\mathrm{MSY}$ and LRP = $0.4B_\mathrm{MSY}$ are suggested in the absence of stock-specific reference points. The framework suggests a limit reference removal rate of $F_\mathrm{MSY}$. Therefore, we refer to the reference removal rate as the limit removal rate (LRR) throughout this document.
 
A harvest control rule based on these reference points that is coincident with the choice of LRP, USR, and LRR would apply a linear reduction in fishing mortality as the stock falls below the USR, and would cease fishing when the stock reaches the LRP [e.g., Figure 6 in @grandin2017].

The $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ (and annual harvest rate $U_\mathrm{MSY}$) are estimated as very large in this model due to selectivity being greater than maturity, as described in Section \textbf{TODO}. We therefore present alternative candidate reference points for `r sp` that are less reliant on estimated selectivity. We suggest an USR = $0.4B_0$ and a LRP = $0.2B_0$. These thresholds are consistent with biomass targets and limits in place in other jusrisdictions including Australia [@smith2007] and the U.S.A. [@restropo1998]. They were also used in the last assessment for `r sp` in `r bc` [@grandin2017].

### Model diagnostics {#scam-model-diag}
The joint posterior distribution was numerically approximated using the Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm in AD Model Builder [@fournier2012]. For the base model and all sensitivity cases, posterior samples were drawn every `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)` iterations from a chain of length `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, resulting in `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` posterior samples (of which the first `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` were dropped as burn-in). Convergence was diagnosed using visual inspection of the traceplots (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-trace) and \@ref(fig:fig-base-trace-selex)) and examination of autocorrelation in posterior chains (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-autocor) and \@ref(fig:fig-base-autocor-selex)). Autocorrelation was negligible at lag values up to 1,000 for all parameters after thinning. There was no strong evidence for lack of convergence in the base model.")

cat("### Fits to Data {#scam-data-fits}
The model generally fit the indices of abundance well (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)). The `r wcvis` has a large fluctuation high and low for successive years of the survey from 2008--2016, which is difficult for the model to fit. The `r qcs` had reasonable fits except for the 2016 point which is underestimated and not within the 95% CI. The `r dcpue` fit particularly well and is the only index to have a value for every year in the assessment. Standardized residuals show mostly even distribution of positive and negative residuals, with evidence of some autocorrelation in the `r dcpue` residuals (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-resids)).

Fits to age compositions for each gear, and log standardized residuals are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-age-fits-ft)--\@ref(fig:fig-base-age-resids-wchgs). Fits were reasonable and there were no strong patterns in the residuals. The log residuals were all bounded by [-2,2] except for very few outliers. Overall there was a slight tendency toward overfitting the age compositions with this model.")

cat("### Parameter Estimates {#scam-param-ests}
Prior and posterior probability distributions of estimated parameters are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts). The median and 95% CI (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) posterior parameter estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:param-estimates-table). With the exception of steepness, the posterior estimates did not appear to be strongly infuenced by the prior probability distributions. The posterior probability distribution for steepness, $h$, was similar to the prior distribution, suggesting that there was little information about this parameter in the data. Sensitivity to the assumed prior for steepness is tested in Section \@ref(sens-analyses). 

Normal prior probability distributions were used for the log catchability parameters $\ln(q_k)$ for the indices of abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts)). Posterior estimates tended to overlap with the left-hand tail of the prior distributions for each index. Sensitivity analyses (discussed in Section XX) indicated that posterior estimates of catchability were sensitive to the mean and standard deviation of the prior distribution.

Pairs plots of posterior samples (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-pairs)) indicated that posterior estimates of $R_0$ and $\bar(R)$ were negatively correlated with the catchability parameters. This, and the influence of the prior distributions on posterior estimates of catchability, indicated that there was limited information in the available data to estimate these important scaling parameters.")

cat("### Selectivity {#scam-selex}
Selectivity-at-age was estimated for the two fisheries and the synoptic surveys (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex) and \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex-qcs)). The `r dcpue` and `r hsmas` fixed selectivities are also shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex).

Posterior estimates of age-at-50%-harvest ($\hat{a}_k$) and the standard deviation in the logistic selectivity ogive ($\hat{\gamma}_k$) are provided in Table \@ref(tab:param-estimates-table). The median posterior estimates of age-at-50%-harvest were higher for females than males for all gears except for the `r wchgs`, which had a much higher estimate for males compared to females. The estimates of standard deviation were similar between sexes.

These estimates were further to the right than expected, but were consistent with the available age composition data (Figure XX), which indicate few observations of younger fish, especially in the latter part of the timeseries. Numerous tests of alternative model confgurations did not result in a lower estimate of age-at-50%-harvest for any gear/sex combination.

`r sp` are thought to mature at around `r f(base_model$dat$age.at.50.mat[1], 1)` years of age for females and `r f(base_model$dat$age.at.50.mat[2], 1)` years of age for females (Figure XX). Therefore, it appears that individuals have several opportunities to spawn before they become vulnerable to the fishery. This in turn resulted in estimates of maximum sustainable harvest rate $U_\mathrm{MSY}$ approaching 1 (discussed in Section XX), implying that under theoretical equilibrium conditions, all of the vulnerable (i.e., fully selected) biomass could be harvested because the population could be sustained by younger spawners that are invulnerable to the fishery. This is a theoretical condition subject to the assumptions in the stock assessment model and the data limitations therein. We strongly advise against this as a harvest strategy and suggest that the age-at-50%-harvest in the trawl fisheries are a primary axis of uncertainty in this stock assessment.")

cat("### Fishery Reference Points {#scam-fishery-ref-points}
Posterior estimates of fishery reference points from the base model are provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-ref-points). The posterior unfished spawning biomass ($SB_0$) (abbreviated to $B_0$ herein) had a median `r f(ref_pts$sbo[2] * 1000)` t and 95% CI ranging from `r f(ref_pts$sbo[1] * 1000)` t to `r f(ref_pts$sbo[3] * 1000)` t (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). Posterior 95% CIs for the candidate LRP $0.2B_0$ and USR $0.4B_0$ are also provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table).

Reference points based on maximum sustainable yield MSY were strongly impacted by estimates of selectivity in the the trawl fisheries described in the previous section. Because the selectivity ogives (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)) were estimated to the right of the maturity ogive (Figure XX), the median estimates of $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ were `r f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet1[2], 2)` for the Freezer trawler fleet and `r f(ref_pts$fmsy_fleet2[2], 2)` for the Shoreside fleet (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). These instantaneous fishing mortalities convert to an annual harvest rate approaching 1 for both fleets, through the equation $U_\mathrm{MSY} = 1-e^{F_\mathrm{MSY}}$, implying that all of the vulnerable biomass (i.e., the biomass that is selected by the fishing gear) could be harvested because the population can be sustained by the spawning biomass that is invulnerable to the fishery (i.e., fish that are between 6 and 9 years old). The relationship between age at maturity and age at first harvest and its effect on fishery reference points was discussed by @myers1998, who described a fishing strategy where overfishing could be avoided by allowing all fish to spawn before they were available to be caught. @froese2004 also discusses reduction in risks of overfishing by allowing fish to spawn before they are caught.

It is important to understand the distinction between vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass. The fishery reference points $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ and $U_\mathrm{MSY}$ refer to catch of the vulnerable biomass $VB_t$, which is determined by the selectivity function
\begin{equation} 
  VB_{t,k} = \sum_{a} N_{a,t} w_{a,t} v_{a,t,k},
(\#eq:vuln-biomass)
\end{equation} 
where $a$ is age, $t$ is year, $k$ is the trawl fishery (Freezer trawlers or Shoreside), $N$ is the population number, $w$ is the average weight-at-age, and $v$ is the vulnerability-at-age in the trawl fisheries (i.e. selectivity) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)).

When the selectivity ogive is located to the right of the maturity ogive, this means that a larger proportion of the total population is mature than vulnerable to the fishery. A comparison between vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass is provided in Section \@ref(scam-biomass).

The median posterior estimate of $B_\mathrm{MSY}$ (and 95% CI), conditional on estimated trawl selectivities and resulting $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ values, was `r f(ref_pts$bmsy[2] * 1000)` t (`r f(ref_pts$bmsy[1] * 1000)`--`r f(ref_pts$bmsy[3] * 1000)`) (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). Posterior CIs for the default LRP $0.4B_\mathrm{MSY}$ and USR $0.8B_\mathrm{MSY}$ are also provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table). The candidate $B_0$-based LRP and USR were approximately twice as large as the candidate $B_\mathrm{MSY}$-based reference points. I.e., $B_0$-based reference points were more precautionary than the $B_\mathrm{MSY}$-based reference points (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)).")

cat("### Biomass {#scam-biomass}
The base model estimates the female spawning biomass to have been on a decreasing trajectory since 2004 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb), Table \@ref(tab:biomass-table)). The posterior median (and 95% CI) female spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is projected to be `r f(proj_bio[2] * 1000)` t (`r f(proj_bio[1] * 1000)`--`r f(proj_bio[3] * 1000)`) (Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)). The median projected beginning-of-year `r assess_yr` spawning biomass, which incorporates fishing mortality arising from the observed `r end_yr` catch, is considerably higher than median estimates of both the default USR of $0.8B_\mathrm{MSY}$ and the default LRP of $0.4B_\mathrm{MSY}$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb), Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)).

The `r assess_yr` spawning biomass was projected to be slightly below the candidate USR $0.4B_0$ and above the LRP $0.2B_0$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb-bo), Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table)).

For comparison, posterior estimates of vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass are shown together in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-sb-vuln-compare). The two estimated vulnerable biomasses are considerably smaller than the spawning biomass, due to the relatively early age at maturity compared to the estimated age-at-50%-harvest, discussed in Section \@ref(scam-ref-points).")
