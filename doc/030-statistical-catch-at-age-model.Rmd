cat("## STATISTICAL CATCH-AT-AGE MODEL {#scam-model}
### Model Description {#scam-model-desc}

A two-sex, Bayesian statistical catch-at-age model was applied to assess the coastwide stock status of `r sp`. The model is based on the Integrated Statistical Catch Age Model (`r iscam`) framework, @martell2011. Full model details are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc).

We define a base model with fixed and estimated parameters described in Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table). A total of `r num_params` model parameters were estimated by the base model (Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table) shows most of these). The model estimated time series of log recruitment anomalies and log fishing mortality rates; and time-invariant values of unfished recruitment, steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship, natural mortality, average recruitment, and logistic selectivity parameters for the two commercial fisheries and the four synoptic surveys. Prior probability distributions for the base model are shown in Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts) and described in Section \@ref(scam-model-priors). Model sensitivity to fixed parameters and to assumed prior probability distributions are presented in Section \@ref(sens-analyses).

The model was conditioned on observed catch data (`r ct_start_yr`--`r ct_end_yr`), which were assumed to be known without error. The model was fit to four survey indices of abundance, the Discard CPUE index, and to age composition data from the two commercial fisheries, and three synoptic surveys. Biological parameters determining weight-at-age and maturity-at-age schedules were estimated independently (Appendix \@ref(app:bio-data-appendix)) and input into the assessment model as fixed parameters that remained constant over time (Table \@ref(tab:growth-params-table)).

Survey biomass indices were treated as relative abundance indices that are directly proportional to the survey vulnerable biomass at the beginning of each year. Observation errors in relative abundance indices were assumed to be log-normally distributed. The catchability parameter $q_k$ was estimated for each index $k$. Prior probability distributions for $\ln(q_k)$ are described in Section \@ref(scam-model-priors).

Age-composition observations were assumed drawn from a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. It was assumed ages were read without error.

Selectivity-at-age for the trawl fisheries, four surveys, and Discard CPUE index was modelled using a two-parameter logistic function with asymptote at 1. Age-at-50%-vulnerability ($\hat{a}_k$) and the standard deviation of the logistic selectivity curve ($\hat{\gamma}_k$) for each gear $k$ were estimated for the trawl fisheries and the three synoptic surveys. No age composition data were available for the `r hsmas` and `r dcpue` so selectivity was fixed with $\hat{a}_k$ = `r f(base_model$ctl$sel[2, 4])` and $\hat{\gamma}_k$ = `r f(base_model$ctl$sel[3, 4], 1)`, similar to estimated values for the other gears. Additional sensitivity runs not included in this assessment document indicated that there was little model sensitivity to this assumption.

Variance components of the model were partitioned into observation and process errors. The key parameter is the total variance (i.e., $\vartheta^2$, total precision). The total variance is partitioned into observation and process error components by the model parameter $\rho$, which represents the proportion of the total variance that is due to observation error [@punt1999; @deriso2007]. The total variance is partitioned into observation errors ($\sigma$) and process errors ($\tau$) using Eq. \@ref(eq:df17) from Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc). The parameters $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were fixed in the current assessment (Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table)) at values that gave $\sigma = 0.2$ and $\tau = 0.8$. See Section \@ref(sens-sigma) for sensitivity analyses to this assumption. See Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc) for further details on the treatment of variance in this assessment.")

cat("### Prior Probability Distributions {#scam-model-priors}

Prior probability distributions for the base model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts) and Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table). Model sensitivities to assumed prior distributions are presented in Sections \@ref(sens-sigma), \@ref(sens-m), and \@ref(sens-q).

Uniform prior probability distributions were assumed for $\ln(R_0)$, $\ln(\bar{R})$, $\ln(R_\mathrm{init})$ and selectivity parameters (Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table)). A Beta distribution was assumed for the steepness ($h$) of the stock-recruit relationship, with shape parameters that resulted in a distribution with mean = `r f(base_h_prior1, 2)` and CV = `r f(base_h_prior2, 2)` (Beta($\alpha$ = `r f(base_h$p1, 1)`, $\beta$ = `r f(base_h_prior2, 1)`)). This prior was based on a literature review on steepness parameters for Pacific flatfish species done by @holt2016 and was used in the `r la` for `r sp`. A review of steepness estimates for flatfish species by @maunder2012 suggested that flatfish steepness using a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship may be around $0.94$ (where $h$ approaching $1.0$ implies recruitment is independent of spawning biomass).

A normal distribution was assumed for $\ln(M)$ for both sexes with mean = $\ln$(`r f(exp(base_m_female$p1), 2)`) and SD = `r f(exp(base_m_female$p2), 2)` for females and mean = $\ln$(`r f(exp(base_m_male$p1), 2)`) and SD = `r f(exp(base_m_male$p2), 2)` for males (in log space). @holt2016 reviewed the literature and stock assessments and assumed a prior probability distribution for M with mean = 0.2 in their assessment of `r bc` Rock Sole (*Lepidopsetta spp.*). @goa2021 assumed a value of M = 0.2 for females and M = 0.35 for males in the assessment of Gulf of Alaska `r sp`; the same was done for the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands stock [@bering2019].

Normal prior probability distributions were assumed for the log survey catchability parameters $\ln(q_k)$ for each survey $k$. Normal distributions with mean = $\ln$(`r base_qk_mean`) and SD = `r base_qk_sd` in log space were selected because the survey estimates of biomass were derived from swept area analysis (Eqs. \@ref(eq:swept-area), \@ref(eq:cpue-density), and \@ref(eq:survey-biomass-variance)) and could therefore reasonably be expected to be within 1â€“2 orders of magnitude of unity. A large standard deviation was used to reflect ignorance of the scale of the swept area analysis compared with the true biomass.")

cat("### Fishery Reference Points {#scam-ref-points}

The DFO Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (PA) policy [@dfo2009] requires stock status to be characterized using three reference points:

1. A Reference Removal Rate
1. An Upper Stock Reference point (USR)
1. A Limit Reference Point (LRP)

Provisional values of USR = $0.8B_\mathrm{MSY}$ and LRP = $0.4B_\mathrm{MSY}$ are suggested in the absence of stock-specific reference points. The framework suggests a limit reference removal rate of $F_\mathrm{MSY}$. Therefore, we refer to the reference removal rate as the limit removal rate (LRR) throughout this document. A harvest control rule based on these reference points that is coincident with the choice of LRP, USR, and LRR would apply a linear reduction in fishing mortality as the stock falls below the USR and would cease fishing when the stock reaches the LRP [e.g., Figure 6 in @grandin2017].

The $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ (and annual harvest rate $U_\mathrm{MSY}$) are estimated to be very large in this model due to selectivity being greater than maturity, as described in Section \@ref(selex). We therefore present $B_0$-based reference points for `r sp` that are less reliant on estimated selectivity. We suggest an LRP = $0.2B_0$ and USR = $0.4B_0$. These are the reference points agreed to in the last assessment for `r sp` in `r bc` [@grandin2017]; we further elaborate on our reasoning below.

**LRP**

We suggest an LRP of $0.2B_0$ as a proxy for recruitment overfishing. A value of $0.2B_0$ is a threshold below which there is typically at least some reduction in per-capita recruitment [@myers1994; @sainsbury2008]. This threshold has been recommended in recent national guidance [@barrett2022]. Furthermore, this threshold is consistent with recommendations in other jurisdictions: a limit value of $0.2B_0$ is the default recommendation (and minimum acceptable value) under Australia's Commonwealth Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy [@dawr2018] and is the default trigger for rebuilding plans under New Zealand's Harvest Strategy [@mf2008].

**USR**

Under the PA Policy, the USR can perform two functions: (1) a 'threshold below which removals must be progressively reduced in order to avoid reaching the LRP' (an operational control point or 'OCP') and (2) a 'target reference point determined by productivity objectives for the stock, broader biological considerations, and social and economic objectives for the fishery' [@dfo2009]. @marentette2020 emphasize that the primary role of the USR is its first role, as an OCP, to avoid the LRP. The PA Policy describes how the USR is meant to be developed by fishery managers with consultation with interested parties and advice from Science. We therefore provide the following science advice regarding the USR. 

First, one rationale for choosing $0.4B_0$ is that under a Schaefer surplus production model, $B_\mathrm{MSY}$ is 0.5 $B_0$ and since 0.8 $B_\mathrm{MSY}$ is the provisional USR and 0.8 $\times$ 0.5 = 0.4, $0.4B_0$ is the equivalent $B_0$-based USR. A similar rationale applies to $0.2B_0$ as the LRP: 0.4 $B_\mathrm{MSY}$ is the provisional LRP and 0.4 $\times$ 0.5 = 0.2 resulting in 0.2 $B_0$ as the LRP.
  
In addition, there is a rationale regarding the USR's role in triggering fishery reductions to reduce risk of the stock breaching the LRP. The PA Policy notes that 'while socio-economic factors may influence the location of the USR, these factors must not diminish its minimum function in guiding management of the risk of approaching the LRP'. We suggest the following scientific factors should be considered with respect to the timing of adjusting fishing intensity as the stock approaches the LRP: (1) the level of uncertainty around the relative spawning biomass; (2) the frequency of assessment; (3) the availability of important data sources; and (4) plausible future rates of decline. We present the following advice with respect to these factors for Arrowtooth Flounder (as will be shown in the results):

1. The level of uncertainty around relative biomass is reasonably high with the 95% CIs roughly spanning the width between $0.2B_0$ and $0.4B_0$. Greater uncertainty means the USR would need to be spaced further from the LRP to ensure an equivalent risk tolerance.
  
2. Although it has been several years since the last assessment, we recommend the stock assessment be updated approximately every two years, when an additional year of data is available from each survey. Longer gaps between assessments would require the USR to be further spaced from the LRP to ensure an equivalent risk.

3. Commercial age samples have not been available for this stock since 2019 and it unclear when this sampling will resume. These data provide a critical source of information about recruitment and selectivity. The assessment results show that declines in estimated recruitment over the last decade are responsible for a large part of the recent estimated declines in SSB. The lack of age samples may introduce uncertainty going forward, which would suggest a larger gap between the LRP and USR for an equivalent risk compared to having this information.
  
4. Although the stock is estimated to have undergone a relatively rapid decline in SSB from about 2012 to 2020, this was associated with higher F's than are currently estimated and this past trajectory is not necessarily indicative of future possible trajectories. A closed-loop simulation analysis would be a rigorous way of evaluating plausible stock trajectories and the ability for a given USR to provide sufficient time to avoid the stock biomass falling below the LRP. We therefore have little information currently about plausible future rates of decline.

With regards to other jurisdictions worldwide, several use 0.4 $B_0$ as a default 'target' stock size [@punt2008, and references therein]; however, these jurisdictions also use this 'target' as an operational control point (OCP) below which fishing mortality is to be reduced to avoid hitting the limit reference point [@punt2008, and references therein], i.e., the definition of the Canadian USR. This is also reflected in the common '40:10' harvest control rule used in the US [@PFMC1998; @punt2008], where 0.4 $B_0$ serves a similar OCP role to the USR. This interpretation would suggest that, despite the use of the term 'target' for 0.4 $B_0$ elsewhere, a USR of 0.4 $B_0$ would be equivalent in function to most other jurisdictions. Most equivalent in function to other jurisdictions would be to consider 0.4 $B_0$ both a 'target' and a USR OCP rather than how they are separated in the PA Policy diagram.

Finally, from a science perspective, we note that 0.4 $B_0$ was previously accepted as the USR for Arrowtooth Flounder [@grandin2017]. We caution that reducing reference points when there is evidence of failing recruitment and declining stock trends would be inconsistent with the precautionary approach as outlined in the DFO PA Policy. Such 'moving the reference point goalposts' can have considerable implications for fisheries sustainability [@silvar-viladomiu2021].
  
**LRR**

Although the PA Policy recommends $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ as a provisional LRR, for reasons outlined above, we suggest $B_0$-based reference points for this stock. We suggest that an equivalent LRR would be fishing mortality F that would take the stock to $0.4 B_0$ at equilibrium given recently observed recruitment. We determined this by projecting the stock 40 years into the future with recruitment deviations randomly drawn with replacement from 2010--2019 (omitting the poorly estimated 2020 and 2021 deviations), using an optimization routine to find the constant catch that would generate SSB matching $0.4 B_0$, and reporting the associated F at the end of 40 years. Given sufficient projection years, performing the projections with a constant F or a constant catch should render the same conclusion.
