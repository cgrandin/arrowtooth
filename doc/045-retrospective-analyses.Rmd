cat("## Retrospective Analyses {#retro-analyses}
The base model was tested for retrospective patterns. This was done by successively removing all catch, age, and index data for 1 year from the end of the time series in the data files and refitting the model. We attempted to run the retrospective model back 10 years, but only the first 8 years would converge. It is likely that attempting to remove too much data led to too few data sources for this split-sex, two-fleet model. This is the reason the the `r la` was parameterized as a single-sex model.

All retrospective models were run using MCMC with a chain length of `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, a sample frequency of `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)`, giving `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` samples, which were then burned in by `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` giving a total of `r f(mcmc_actual_samples)` samples retained for inference. This was the same as all other models in this assessment.

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-biomass) shows the absolute biomass for the base model compared with the retrospective models. Following the subtraction of years by looking at the trajectories, we see that the -4 years model (ending in 2018) follows a different path than the years following (2019--present). This is due to the large drop in biomass seen in 2019 in the `r wcvis`, `r hss`, and `r dcpue` (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)). The model is highly sensitive to these drops in the indices, all of which occur in the same year. If this assessment had taken place prior to 2019 with this model, the outcome would have been noteablly different than it is now. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-biomass-closer) gives a closer view of the trajectories.

The $B_0$ estimates are also segregated into two distinct groups by the -4 year model, with those from 2019--present being lower than those prior to 2019. When the absolute trajectories are divided by these $B_0$ values we can inspect the relative biomass trends (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-biomass-rel)). The high $B_0$ estimates for the models prior to 2019 force the relative biomass downwards giving the impression of a more depleted stock in earlier years when compared to the more recent models.

Comparing recruitment estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-recr)), most appear similar between models; however, there is an obvious outlier---the 2014 recruitment for the 2014 model. This can also be seen in in Figure 21 of the `r la`. The 2014 cohort was highly uncertain at that time with the data that was available, even with the single-sex model. The $R_0$ estimates follow the same grouping seen in the absolute biomass figure. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-recr-closer) gives a closer view.

There is a decrease in fishing mortality for the models prior to 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-f)), which corresponds to the increasing biomass trend in those models. 

The fits to the indices of abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-index-fits)) show a clear divergence for the models prior to 2019. The log standardized residuals (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-retro-index-resids)) show that indices for those models fit neither better nor worse overall than the post-2019 models. The post-2019 models have residuals that are more dispersed from each other than the pre-2019 models, which have very similar fits in most cases. This implies that the recent large drops in biomass in the indices are more difficult for the model to resolve, which would explain the difficulty for the model in fitting the `r qcs`, which does not show these drops.
