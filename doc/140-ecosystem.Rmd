Arrowtooth Flounder are habitat and prey generalists [@yang1993, @doyle2018]. However, we rely on details of diet composition reported from Alaska, because no diet data are collected on any of the surveys used in this assessment. Based on almost 2000 stomachs collected in the early 1990s in the GOA, Arrowtooth Flounder consume a diet dominated by zooplankton, fish, and benthic invertebrates [@yang1993, @goa2019]. For juvenile arrowtooth (<= 20 cm TL), euphausiids made up nearly 60% of their diet, followed by capelin at 24%. Adult Arrowtooth Flounder consumed mostly capelin, euphausiids, adult and juvenile pollock, Pandalid shrimp, herring, and other forage fish, none of which account for more than 22% of the overall diet. In the same region and time period, predation by Pacific halibut, Steller sea lions, and Pacific cod together explained about 10% of adult arrowtooth mortality and the flatfish trawl fishery accounted for 2% [@goa2019]. Juvenile Arrowtooth Flounder mortality was caused by adult Arrowtooth Flounder, and both adult and juvenile pollock, but the total of these mortality sources is less than 7% of juvenile arrowtooth production [@goa2019].

Migration patterns are not well known for Arrowtooth Flounder, but there is some indication that larger fish may migrate to deeper water in winter and shallower water in summer [@arf1995]. Spawning and hatching occur in these deeper waters (> 400 m) along the continental shelf break in winter [@blood2007]. At these depths, predation risk is relatively low, and cold temperatures along with intrinsically low metabolic rates ensure extended availability of yolk reserves, lowering the risk of larval starvation [@doyle2018]. Larval duration and drift is protracted, contributing to widespread delivery of larvae to coastal, continental shelf and slope waters, resulting in low connectivity between spawning and settlement areas [@doyle2018]. In the GOA, the smallest fish (< 10 cm) were typically found shallower than 200 m with all immature fish (< 30 cm) concentrating at < 400 m. In colder years, these size classes tended to be found deeper. In contrast, mature fish (30 - 60 cm) tended to be found deepest (> 800 m) in warmer years [@doyle2018]. A preliminary climate-related vulnerability assessment for GOA indicated low risk, high resilience overall; however, there exists some potential stage-specific sensitivity to temporal mis-match between larvae and zooplankton prey with increased temperatures [@doyle2018]. 

Within Canadian Pacific waters, a lack of correlation between change in abundance and changes in condition suggests that bottom-up ecosystem effects are unlikely to be driving overall stock status for Arrowtooth Flounder. Coastwide, the condition index dropped steadily between 2004 and 2012 (Fig. \@ref(fig:condition-index)), while the index of abundance for the same area increased by over 50% (Fig. \@ref(fig:geo-indexes-cpue)). The evidence that condition tends to be higher in deeper, and therefore cooler, waters is consistent with findings of some potential sensitivity to temperature [@english2021]. Local warming (positive temperature velocity) was associated with declines in biomass only in already warmer areas, and associated with increases biomass of immatures (~ 38 cm for females, ~ 31 cm for males) in cooler areas.However, the condition index does climb steeply between 2013 and 2015, including the period of the 2014-2016 marine heat wave, in a way that mirrors the abundances of some more southern species of euphausiid [@boldt2021]. In contrast, mean body condition in the GOA was low during the marine heat wave (2015) and even lower in 2017 [@goa2019]. This was hypothesized to be due to both increased energetic demands with warm temperatures and lack of forage fish prey. Marine heat wave conditions occurred again in the Northeast Pacific in 2018, and 2019-2020, although they were not as extreme as in 2014-2016 [@boldt2021].

TODO: something about abundances of natural predators: Steller's Sea Lion, dogfish, pcod, any others?

<!-- "Arrowtooth Flounder spawn in deep waters (>400m) along the continental shelf break in winter (Blood et al. 2007). They are batch spawners, spawning from fall to winter off Washington State at depths greater than 366m (Rickey 1995)." alaska assesment" -->

<!-- "Trophic studies (Yang 1993, Hollowed, et al. 1995, Hollowed et al. 2000) suggest Arrowtooth Flounder are an important component in the dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska benthic ecosystem. They are an apex predator in the Gulf of Alaska and are habitat and prey generalists (Doyle et al. 2018). The majority of the prey by weight of arrowtooth larger than 40 cm was pollock, the remainder consisting of herring, capelin, euphausids, shrimp and cephalopods (Yang 1993). The percent of pollock in the diet of Arrowtooth Flounder increases for sizes greater than 40 cm (Figure 7.2, Doyle et al. 2018). Arrowtooth Flounder 15 cm to 30 cm consume mostly shrimp, capelin, euphausiids and herring, with small amounts of pollock and other miscellaneous fish. Groundfish predators include Pacific cod and halibut (see Ecosystem Considerations section)." -->

<!-- "Differences in distribution of Arrowtooth Flounder were compared between warm and cold years, where warm years included 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2015 and cold years included 1996, 1999, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 (Doyle et al. 2018). Results showed some effect of temperature on distribution (Figure 7.3). Fish less than 300mm were found typically <400m in warm years but deeper in cold years. Younger fish -->
<!-- <100m were found >200m only in colder years. ATF 300-600mm were found in the deepest stations >800m in warm years. High densities of fish were greater at 200-400m in cold years. Highest densities of larger, older fish >600mm were found over the slope in cold years (Doyle et al. 2018)." -->

<!-- "In general predators of juvenile Arrowtooth Flounder appear to be stable or declining. Steller sea lion trends have stabilized or continued to decline in the Gulf of Alaska. Large Pacific cod are estimated at low biomass. Together these suggest no apparent concern for an increase in juvenile arrowtooth predator populations. However, the western GOA shelf area has experienced heatwave conditions since late September 2018. Based on knowledge gained from the 2014-2016 heatwave, we consider this to be unfavorable for arrowtooth as the prolonged increased temperatures likely increased their metabolic demands as well as the metabolic demands of their groundfish predators. It is unknown how long the heatwave in this area will persist. We consider the concern level to be 2â€”some indicators showing adverse signals relevant to the stock but the pattern is not consistent across all indicators." -->

<!-- "During the 2019 bottom trawl survey, the average condition (defined as weight-length residuals) was near the time series mean indicating that the overall foraging landscape for Arrowtooth Flounder was sufficient. This is in contrast to 2015 and 2017 when mean body condition was low and record low (respectively), indicating that Arrowtooth Flounder were not able to forage sufficiently to meet energetic demands. This was likely related to the 2014-2016 marine heatwave which caused both increased energetic demands for groundfish due to the warm temperatures and lack of forage fish prey. Condition was slightly above the time series mean from Kodiak to Southeast, but remained slightly below from west of Kodiak to Unimak Pass, indicating the potential for regional variation in Arrowtooth Flounder prey abundance. -->
<!-- Both juvenile and adult Arrowtooth Flounder eat euphausiids. While euphausiids were at record abundance during the September 2018 Seward Line sampling, abundance estimates were low in May 2019. Acoustically- derived estimates of euphausiid abundance during summer 2019 were moderate to low. Additionally, the reproductive success of planktivorous auklets at the Semedi Islands was average. Taken together, these euphausiid indicators suggest moderate to low euphausiid abundance during 2019. -->
<!-- Forage fish indicators suggest mixed signals for abundance during 2019. Spring and late summer surveys for young of year groundfish found very few. However, forage-fish eating seabirds at the Semidis had strong reproductive success, although observations indicated that diets were unusual relative to other years where typical forage fish such as age-0 gadids, capelin, and sand lance predominate. Taken together these indicators suggest poor forage fish prey abundance." -->
