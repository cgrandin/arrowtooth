"Arrowtooth Flounder spawn in deep waters (>400m) along the continental shelf break in winter (Blood et al. 2007). They are batch spawners, spawning from fall to winter off Washington State at depths greater than 366m (Rickey 1995)." alaska assesment"

"Trophic studies (Yang 1993, Hollowed, et al. 1995, Hollowed et al. 2000) suggest Arrowtooth Flounder are an important component in the dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska benthic ecosystem. They are an apex predator in the Gulf of Alaska and are habitat and prey generalists (Doyle et al. 2018). The majority of the prey by weight of arrowtooth larger than 40 cm was pollock, the remainder consisting of herring, capelin, euphausids, shrimp and cephalopods (Yang 1993). The percent of pollock in the diet of Arrowtooth Flounder increases for sizes greater than 40 cm (Figure 7.2, Doyle et al. 2018). Arrowtooth Flounder 15 cm to 30 cm consume mostly shrimp, capelin, euphausiids and herring, with small amounts of pollock and other miscellaneous fish. Groundfish predators include Pacific cod and halibut (see Ecosystem Considerations section)."

"Differences in distribution of Arrowtooth Flounder were compared between warm and cold years, where warm years included 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2015 and cold years included 1996, 1999, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 (Doyle et al. 2018). Results showed some effect of temperature on distribution (Figure 7.3). Fish less than 300mm were found typically <400m in warm years but deeper in cold years. Younger fish
<100m were found >200m only in colder years. ATF 300-600mm were found in the deepest stations >800m in warm years. High densities of fish were greater at 200-400m in cold years. Highest densities of larger, older fish >600mm were found over the slope in cold years (Doyle et al. 2018)."

"In general predators of juvenile Arrowtooth Flounder appear to be stable or declining. Steller sea lion trends have stabilized or continued to decline in the Gulf of Alaska. Large Pacific cod are estimated at low biomass. Together these suggest no apparent concern for an increase in juvenile arrowtooth predator populations. However, the western GOA shelf area has experienced heatwave conditions since late September 2018. Based on knowledge gained from the 2014-2016 heatwave, we consider this to be unfavorable for arrowtooth as the prolonged increased temperatures likely increased their metabolic demands as well as the metabolic demands of their groundfish predators. It is unknown how long the heatwave in this area will persist. We consider the concern level to be 2â€”some indicators showing adverse signals relevant to the stock but the pattern is not consistent across all indicators."

"During the 2019 bottom trawl survey, the average condition (defined as weight-length residuals) was near the time series mean indicating that the overall foraging landscape for Arrowtooth Flounder was sufficient. This is in contrast to 2015 and 2017 when mean body condition was low and record low (respectively), indicating that Arrowtooth Flounder were not able to forage sufficiently to meet energetic demands. This was likely related to the 2014-2016 marine heatwave which caused both increased energetic demands for groundfish due to the warm temperatures and lack of forage fish prey. Condition was slightly above the time series mean from Kodiak to Southeast, but remained slightly below from west of Kodiak to Unimak Pass, indicating the potential for regional variation in Arrowtooth Flounder prey abundance.
Both juvenile and adult Arrowtooth Flounder eat euphausiids. While euphausiids were at record abundance during the September 2018 Seward Line sampling, abundance estimates were low in May 2019. Acoustically- derived estimates of euphausiid abundance during summer 2019 were moderate to low. Additionally, the reproductive success of planktivorous auklets at the Semedi Islands was average. Taken together, these euphausiid indicators suggest moderate to low euphausiid abundance during 2019.
Forage fish indicators suggest mixed signals for abundance during 2019. Spring and late summer surveys for young of year groundfish found very few. However, forage-fish eating seabirds at the Semidis had strong reproductive success, although observations indicated that diets were unusual relative to other years where typical forage fish such as age-0 gadids, capelin, and sand lance predominate. Taken together these indicators suggest poor forage fish prey abundance."
