A set of bridging models was run to determine the effects of incremental model modifications while moving from the single-sex, single-fleet 2015 model to the split-sex, two-fleet model used in this assessment.

The base model from the `r la` (@grandin2017) was run with the newest version of the iSCAM code and the original data files. The parameter estimates, reference points, estimated trajectories, index fits, and age comp fits were determined to be identical. The 2015 model was a female-only catch-at-age model with 4 indices of abundance which included the three Synoptic surveys and the Hecate Strait Multispecies assemblage survey.

The Technical Working Group (TWG) agreed that the model should be split-sex, based on the sexual dimorphism seen and there being 8 more years of data since the `r la`, which allowed for an adequate number of age proportion specimens for each sex.

All bridge models were run using MCMC with a chain length of `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, a sample frequency of `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)`, giving `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` samples, which were then burned in by `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` giving a total of `r f(mcmc_actual_samples)` samples actually used.

cat("Each model in this list is based on the previous one with only one change made so incremental changes can be tracked.

1. 2015 Base model [@grandin2017].
1. Extracted the data for the 2015 model using the [gfplot](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfplot) package, which has been used in several assessments and in the [gfsynopsis](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfsynopsis) report.
1. Using the same data extraction methods as in the previous step, appended data up to and including 2021.
1. Added the `r wchgs` index and age comps. This was tried to determine if the additional survey years since 2015 contributed anything to the model fit.
1. Switched the age comp likelihood from Multivariate Normal Logistic to the saturating parameterization of the Dirichlet-Multinomial [@thorson2016]. This was done to avoid manually reweighting the age proportions for each different model run, and instead have the weighting paramaterized in the model.
1. Changed the model from one to two commercial fleets. This splits the commercial trawl catch into catch from Freezer Trawlers and Shoreside fleets. This was done by recommendation of the TWG, since the large freezer trawlers may fish differently and have different selectivity than the shoreside vessels.
1. Added the Discard CPUE index. This was suggested by the Technical Working Group (TWG) and is an index for vessels that were not fishing for `r sp` and therefore were discarding all that they caught incidentally. The selectivity could not be estimated for this index since there are no age composition data for it, so its selectivity was fixed to values representative of other estimated selectivities from other gears. See Appendix \@ref(app:dcpue) for details on how this index was genereated.
1. Converted the model from female-only to a split-sex model. In this model, the two natural mortality parameters for male and female were fixed. In the previous models, the female natural mortality was estimated. This was done due to poor diagnostics when the parameters were estimated, and to follow what was done in recent Gulf of Alaska assessments (@spies2019).
1. Changed fishing year to Feb. 21 - Feb. 20, which is the range currently used by fisheries management for the fishing year.
1. Removed the `r wchgs` index and age comps. It was not contributing anything to the assessment and the estimated selectivities were not viable due to too few samples. Its removal was suggested by the Technical Working Group (TWG).
1. Fixed both male and female natural morality parameters. The estimated values were quite low for this species based on previous assessments in the area (@grandin2017, @spies2019).

cat("Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group1) shows the absolute and relative spawning biomass for the first four bridging models in the list above (list items 1-4). Changing the data extraction method for all data up to 2014 does not have much effect, with only a small difference in 2015 absolute biomass and a very small difference in 2015 relative biomass. Small changes in data are mainly due to changes in survey indices, which are caused by survey blocks being removed from the entire survey series. These blocks were found to be unfishable or inappropriate for the index in the surveys since 2014 and were removed from the entire series, changing the historical indices slightly from those included in the `r la`.

Adding the data from 2015--2021 causes a large effect in the model. The biomass begins dropping more quickly as far back as 2002, with a steep drop from 2011--2020. From 2021--2022 the model shows in upward trend.

Adding the `r wchgs` age compositions and index into the model has a scaling effect in the earlier part of the trajectory, but both absolute and relative biomasses are near identical for 2022.

cat("Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2) shows the absolute and relative spawning biomass for the second group of four bridging models (list items 5-8). Changing the age weighting to a parameterized form, the saturated Dirichlet Multinomial (DM) [@thorson2016], causes a drop in absolute biomass. The first model in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2), when compared to the last model in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group1) shows this. The inital biomass estimate also drops, however, so the relative biomass remains at a similar level with the change to DM.
    
The commercial trawl was split into two fleets, the `r base_model$dat$fleet_gear_names[1]` and `r base_model$dat$fleet_gear_names[2]` fleets. This changed the model internals significantly but had negligible effect on the biomass and relative biomass trajectories.

Adding the Discard CPUE (DCPUE) index to the model had no effect to the output biomass. The details of the DCPUE are given in Appendix \@ref(app:dcpue).

The next step in the bridging was to convert the model into split-sex. All previous bridge models were female-only and this step involved significant improvements to the iSCAM model code. This change caused a drop in end-year biomass and relative biomass, and some overall scaling up of the historical relative biomass trajectory.

cat("The biomass plots for the final group of four bridging model (list items 9-12) is in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group3). The fishing year was changed from what it was in the `r la`, January 1--December 31 to February 21--February 20. This change was made to reflect the actual date of February 21 that the annual fishery is started in Canada. The effect of this is negligble on the median of the absolute and relative biomass, but interestingly the credible interval of the absolute biomass is lowered significantly. The credible interval on the $B_0$ estimate is still as high as the previous model, conversion to split sex, so that effect is not carried over to the relative biomass.
    
The `r wchgs` was removed, as it was in the `r la`, as it has very little effect on the biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group3)) and some troubling selectivity estimates.

The natural mortalities coming from the model at this point were about the same, `r f(models$bridge_grps[[3]][[2]]$mcmccalcs$m_male_quants[,1][2], 2)` for males and `r f(models$bridge_grps[[3]][[2]]$mcmccalcs$m_female_quants[,1][2], 2)` for females. While the value for males made sense, the female value was much lower than what was expected. The `r la` estimated a value of 0.314 for female natural mortality and the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) assessment use a fixed value of 0.35 [@spies2019]. We decided to fix the natural mortalities at the same values as the GOA assessment, which are 0.2 for males and 0.35 for females.

The fit to the `r qcs` index was found to be unacceptable, so attempts were made to improve it. The only modification that yielded a better fit without producing unrealistic selectivity parameter estimates was to employ time-varying selectivity for the `r qcs`. Selectivities for two time blocks were estimated, `r tv_block1` and `r tv_block2`. Other block reanges and addition of more blocks were examined but none performed as well as the two-block configuration that was settled on.
