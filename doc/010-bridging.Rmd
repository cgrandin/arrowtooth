A set of bridging models was run to determine the effects of incremental model modifications while moving from the single-sex, single-fleet 2015 model to the split-sex, two-fleet model used in this assessment.

The base model from the 2015 assessment (@grandin2017) was run with the newest version of the iSCAM code and the original data files. The parameter estimates, reference points, estimated trajectories, index fits, and age comp fits were determined to be identical. The 2015 model was a female-only catch-at-age model with 4 indices of abundance which included the three Synoptic surveys and the Hecate Strait Multispecies assemblage survey.

The Technical Working Group (TWG) agreed that the model should be split-sex, based on the sexual dimorphism seen and there being 8 more years of data since the 2015 assessment, which allowed for an adequate number of age proportion specimens for each sex.

1. 2015 Base model (@grandin2017).
1. Extracted the data for the 2015 model using the [gfplot](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfplot) package, which has been used in several assessments and in the [gfsynopsis](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfsynopsis) report.
1. Using the same data extraction methods as in the previous step, appended data up to and including 2021.
1. Switched the age comp likelihood from Multivariate Normal Logistic to the saturating parameterization of the Dirichlet-Multinomial (@thorson2017). This was done to avoid manually reweighting the age proportions for each different model run, and instead have the weighting paramaterized in the model.
1. Added the `r wchgs` index and age comps. This was tried to determine if the additional survey years since 2015 contributed anything to the model fit.
1. Changed the model from one to two commercial fleets. This splits the commercial trawl catch into catch from Freezer Trawlers and Shoreside fleets. This was done by recommendation of the TWG, since the large freezer trawlers may fish differently and have different selectivity than the shoreside vessels.
1. Added the Discard CPUE index. This was suggested by the Technical Working Group (TWG) and is an index for vessels that were not fishing for `r sp` and therefore were discarding all that they caught incidentally. The selectivity could not be estimated for this index since there are no age composition data for it, so its selectivity was fixed to values representative of other estimated selectivities from other gears. See Appendix \@ref(app:dcpue) for details on how this index was genereated.
1. Converted the model from female-only to a split-sex model. In this model, the two natural mortality parameters for male and female were fixed. In the previous models, the female natural mortality was estimated. This was done due to poor diagnostics when the parameters were estimated, and to follow what was done in recent Gulf of Alaska assessments (@spies2019).
1. Changed fishing year to Feb. 21 - Feb 20, which is the range currently used by fisheries management for the fishing year.
1. Removed the `r wchgs` index and age comps. It was not contributing anything to the assessment and the estimated selectivities were not viable due to too few samples. Its removal was suggested by the Technical Working Group (TWG).
1. Fixed both male and female natural morality parameters. The estimated values were quite low for this species based on previous assessments in the area (@grandin2017, @spies2019).
