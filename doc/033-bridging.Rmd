### Bridge Models {#bridging}
A set of bridging models was run to determine the effects of incremental model modifications while moving from the single-sex, single-fleet `r la` model to the split-sex, two-fleet model used in this assessment.

The base model from the `r la` [@grandin2017] was run with the newest version of the `r iscam` [@iscam] code and the original data files. The parameter estimates, reference points, estimated trajectories, index fits, and age composition fits were determined to be identical. The 2015 model was a female-only catch-at-age model with 4 indices of abundance, which included the three Synoptic surveys and the Hecate Strait Multispecies assemblage survey.

The Technical Working Group (TWG) agreed that the model should be split-sex, based on the sexual dimorphism observed in the age and length data for this species, and there being 8 more years of data since the `r la`, which allowed for a larger number of age proportion specimens for each sex.

All bridge models were run using MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) sampling with a chain length of `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, retaining every `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)`th sample, giving `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` samples, which were then burned in by `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` giving a total of `r f(mcmc_actual_samples)` samples used for inference.

cat("Each model in this list is based on the previous one with only one change made so incremental changes can be tracked.

1. 2015 Base model [@grandin2017].
1. Extracted the data for the 2015 model using the [gfdata](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfdata)/[gfplot](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfplot) packages, which have been used in several assessments and in the [gfsynopsis](https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfsynopsis) report [@anderson2019synopsis; @dfo2022synopsis].
1. Using the same data extraction methods as in the previous step, appended data up to and including 2021. The proportion female was changed in this step from 0.70 to `r total_prop_female`.
1. Added the `r wchgs` index and age composition data. This was tried to determine how the additional survey years since 2015 contributed to the model fit.
1. Switched the age composition likelihood from multinomial to the saturating parameterization of the Dirichlet-multinomial [@thorson2016]. We did this because in more complex model configurations, the multivariate normal logistic had convergence issues and the standard multinomial would have required manually re-weighting the age proportions for each model run [@francis2016].
1. Changed the model from one to two commercial fleets. This splits the commercial trawl catch into catch from Freezer Trawlers and Shoreside fleets. This was done on the recommendation of the Technical Working Group (TWG) since the large freezer trawlers may fish differently and have different selectivity than the shoreside vessels.
1. Added a Discard CPUE index. This was suggested by the TWG and is an index of catch per unit effort for vessels that were not fishing for `r sp` and therefore were discarding all that they caught incidentally. The selectivity could not be estimated for this index since there are no age composition data for it, so its selectivity was fixed to values representative of other estimated selectivities from other gears. See Appendix \@ref(app:dcpue) for details on how this index was generated.
1. Converted the model from female-only to a split-sex model. In this model, the two natural mortality parameters for male and female were estimated.
1. Changed fishing year to start on February 21 (vs. January 1), which is the date currently used by Fisheries Management for the fishing year.
1. Removed the `r wchgs` index and age comps. The survey was not contributing meaningfully to the assessment and the estimated selectivities were not viable due to too few samples. Its removal was suggested by the TWG.
1. Fixed both male and female natural mortality parameters. The estimated values were quite low for this species based on assessments in neighbouring jurisdictions [@goa2017; @goa2019; @goa2020; @goa2021].

**Bridge models group 1 (models 1-4)**
Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group1) shows the absolute and relative spawning biomass for the first four bridging models in the list above (list items 1--4). Changing the data extraction method for all data up to 2014 had minimal effect, with only a small difference in 2015 absolute biomass and a very small difference in 2015 relative biomass. Small changes in data are mainly due to changes in survey indices, which are caused by survey blocks being removed from the entire survey series. These blocks were found to be unfishable or inappropriate for the index in the surveys since 2014 and were removed from the entire series, changing the historical indices slightly from those included in the `r la`.

Adding the data from 2015--`r base_model$dat$end.yr` caused a large change in the biomass trajectories (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group1)). The biomass began dropping more rapidly starting in 2002, with a relatively steep drop from 2010--2020. This decline in the biomass is caused mainly by the declining indices of abundance in that time period. From 2021--2022 the model shows the beginnings of an upward trend. Credible intervals (CIs) became much narrower with the addition of the 2015--`r base_model$dat$end.yr` data. However, the estimated parameters (except steepness) are all moderately to highly correlated (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-bridge3-pairs)). All the bridging models that follow have high correlation between parameters, except for the last one in which the natural mortalities for both sexes were fixed.

Adding the `r wchgs` age compositions and index into the model had a scaling effect in the earlier part of the trajectory, but both absolute and relative biomasses were nearly identical for 2022 (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group1)).

cat("**Bridge models group 2 (models 5-8)**
Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2) shows the absolute and relative spawning biomass for the second group of four bridging models (list items 5--8). Changing the age data weighting to the saturated Dirichlet multinomial (DM) [@thorson2016], caused a drop in absolute biomass and $B_0$. The $B_0$ median for the first model in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2), when compared to the $B_0$ median for the last model in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group1) shows a difference of  `r f(as.numeric(bvals[[1]][[4]]$bo[1]) - as.numeric(bvals[[2]][[1]]$bo[1]))` thousand t (from `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$bo[1]` to `r bvals[[2]][[1]]$bo[1]` thousand t). However, the biomass estimates were also scaled down, so the `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$depl[3]` relative biomass only dropped a small amount (`r bvals[[1]][[4]]$depl[1]` to `r bvals[[2]][[1]]$depl[1]`).
    
For the next bridging model, the commercial trawl fishery was split into two fleets: the `r base_model$dat$fleet_gear_names[1]` and `r base_model$dat$fleet_gear_names[2]` fleets. This changed the model internals but had negligible effect on the biomass and relative biomass trajectories (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2)).

Adding the `r dcpue` (DCPUE) to the model had almost no effect on the absolute biomass and $B_0$ estimates. It did, however, reduce the credible interval (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2)) on both absolute and relative biomass series.

The next step in the bridging was to convert the model into a split-sex model. All previous bridge models were female-only. This step involved significant modifications to the `r iscam` model code. This change caused a drop in final-year biomass and relative biomass, and some overall scaling up of the historical relative biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group2)). The switch to a split-sex model did have an impact on the index fit to the `r qcs`---the first few years' fit was closer to the inital index point, which was significantly lower than the rest in the series (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-index-group2)). This fit is a function of the selectivity estimate, which is unreasonable for this model (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-group2-sel)). The selectivity age-at-50% estimates ($\hat{a}$) for females in the `r qcs` for this model were (median, CI [credible interval]) `r split_sex_model_sel_ahat`. The standard deviation of the age-at-50% estimates ($\hat{\gamma}$) were `r split_sex_model_sel_ghat`. These are clearly impossible, and affected the index fit for the `r qcs` in a negative way.

cat("**Bridge models group 3 (models 9--13)**
The biomass plots for the final group of bridging models (list items 9-13) can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group3). For the first of these models, the fishing year was changed from what it was in the `r la`, January 1--December 31 to February 21--February 20. This change was made to reflect the start date for the fishery each year in Canada (February 21). The effect of this is the median $B_0$ dropping a small amount from `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$sbo[1]` to `r bvals[[2]][[1]]$sbo[1]` thousand t, and the `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$depl[3]` relative biomass being reduced from `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$depl[1]` to `r bvals[[2]][[1]]$depl[1]`. The credible interval of the absolute biomass is reduced by this change in fishery timing from `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$sbt[2]` to `r bvals[[2]][[1]]$sbt[2]`. However, the credible interval on the relative biomass is still very similar to the previous model in group 2, `r bvals[[1]][[4]]$depl[2]` for the previous model vs. `r bvals[[2]][[1]]$depl[2]` for the one with the fishery timing change (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group3)).
    
The `r wchgs` was removed (it was also removed in the `r la`) as it had little effect on the biomass and poor selectivity estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:bridge-biomass-group3)).

The natural mortality estimates from the model at this point were `r bvals[[3]][[2]]$m_male[1]` for males and `r bvals[[3]][[2]]$m_female[1]` for females with credible intervals of `r bvals[[3]][[2]]$m_male[2]` and `r bvals[[3]][[2]]$m_female[2]` respectively. While the fixed value for females in assessments done in neighbouring jurisdictions (0.20) fell within the uncertainty in this model, the male estimate was much lower than what was used in neighboring stocks. Based on the estimated natural mortality values and the high correlation between estimated parameters for this model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-bridge10-pairs)), we decided to fix the natural mortalities at the same values as the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands assessments [@goa2021; @goa2020; @goa2019; @bering2019], which are 0.20 for females and 0.35 for males.
