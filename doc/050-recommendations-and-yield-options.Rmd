## DECISION TABLES
### Base Model {#decisions-base}

Performance measureswere calculated over a sequence of alternative `r end_yr` projected catch levels and are based on one-year projections to `r assess_yr`. Projected, bias-corrected log recruitment anomalies in `r end_yr` and `r assess_yr` were drawn randomly from a normal distribution, $~N(0,\tau)$.

Posterior estimates of reference points (MSY and $B_0$-based reference points) and benchmarks are provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table). Decision tables are presented showing predicted probabilities of undesirable states under alternative `r assess_yr` projected catch levels. An undesirable biomass-based performance measure is defined to occur when the `r proj_yr` projected  spawning biomass is below the candidate reference point or benchmark, i.e., the ratio `r paste0('$B_{', proj_yr, '}/B_\mathrm{ReferencePoint} < 1$')`. An undesirable fishing mortality-based performance measure is defined to occur when projected `r assess_yr` fishing mortality is above the reference point, i.e.,
`r paste0('$F_{', assess_yr, '}/F_\mathrm{ReferencePoint} > 1$')`. Probabilities in the decision tables are measured as the proportion of posterior samples that meet criteria above (i.e., proportion of posterior samples < 1 for biomass-based performance measures; and proportion of posterior samples > 1 for fishing mortality-based performance measures).

The base model decision table is presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-table). Alternative `r assess_yr` catch levels are presented from 0 t to 50,000 t. Catches are shown in 2,000 t increments from zero to 10,000 t; then in 1,000 t increments between 10,000 t and 20,000 t; and then in 2,000 t increments from 22,000 t to 30,000 t. A catch level of 50,000 t is also given for reference purposes as it was included in the last assessment [@grandin2017].

The model-predicted probability of the `r proj_yr` spawning biomass being below the `r assess_yr` spawning biomass ranged from `r prob_proj_less_assess_0` under zero `r assess_yr` catch to `r prob_proj_less_assess_10` under 10,000 t of catch, which is double the current total TAC. At 50,000 t, the probability is `r prob_proj_less_assess_50`. The TAC that is closest to 0.5 probability of the biomass declining from `r assess_yr` to `r proj_yr` (while still being below 0.5) is `r prob_less_50_50$tac` t, at a probability of `r val_less_50_50`.

The probability of being below the candidate USR of $0.4B_0$ was from `r range_below_04bo[1]` to `r range_below_04bo[2]` over the range of catch levels considered. The probability of being below the candidate USR of $0.8B_{MSY}$ was from `r range_below_08bmsy[1]` to `r range_below_08bmsy[2]` over the range of catch levels considered. The probability of being below the candidate LRP of $0.2B_0$ was from `r range_below_02bo[1]` to `r range_below_02bo[2]` over the range of catch levels considered. The probability of being below the candidate LRP of $0.4B_{MSY}$ was zero for all catch levels considered.

All catch levels had a probability of greater than 0.5 of the `r proj_yr` biomass being under the $0.4B_0$ reference point. The lowest catch level having a probabilty of greater than 0.5 of the `r proj_yr` biomass being under the $0.2B_0$ limit reference point was `r row_greater_50_50_02bo$tac` t, with a probability of `r prob_greater_50_50_02bo`.
