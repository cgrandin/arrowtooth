## DECISION TABLES
### Base Model {#decisions-base}

Performance measures were calculated over a sequence of alternative `r end_yr` projected catch levels and are based on one-year projections to `r assess_yr`. Projected, bias-corrected log recruitment anomalies in `r end_yr` and `r assess_yr` were drawn randomly from a normal distribution, $~N(0,\tau^2)$.

Posterior estimates of reference points (MSY and $B_0$-based reference points) and benchmarks are provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table). Decision tables are presented showing predicted probabilities of undesirable states under alternative `r assess_yr` projected catch levels. An undesirable biomass-based performance measure is defined to occur when the `r proj_yr` projected  spawning biomass is below the candidate reference point or benchmark, i.e., the ratio `r paste0('$B_{', proj_yr, '}/B_\mathrm{ReferencePoint} < 1$')`. An undesirable fishing mortality-based performance measure is defined to occur when projected `r assess_yr` fishing mortality is above the reference point, i.e., `r paste0('$F_{', assess_yr, '}/F_\mathrm{ReferencePoint} > 1$')`. Probabilities in the decision tables are measured as the proportion of posterior samples that meet criteria above (i.e., proportion of posterior samples < 1 for biomass-based performance measures; and proportion of posterior samples > 1 for fishing mortality-based performance measures).

The base model decision table is presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-table). Alternative `r assess_yr` catch levels are presented from 0 t to 50,000 t. Catches are shown in 2,000 t increments from zero to 10,000 t; then in 1,000 t increments between 10,000 t and 20,000 t; and then in 2,000 t increments from 22,000 t to 30,000 t. A catch level of 50,000 t is also given for reference purposes as it was included in the last assessment [@grandin2017].

The model-predicted probability of the `r proj_yr` spawning biomass being below the `r assess_yr` spawning biomass ranged from `r prob_proj_less_assess_0` under zero `r assess_yr` catch to `r prob_proj_less_assess_10` under 10,000 t of catch, which is double the current total TAC. At 50,000 t, the probability is `r prob_proj_less_assess_50`. The TAC that is closest to 0.5 probability of the biomass declining from `r assess_yr` to `r proj_yr` (while still being below 0.5) is `r prob_less_50_50$tac` t, at a probability of `r val_less_50_50`.

The probability of being below the candidate USR of $0.4B_0$ was from `r range_below_04bo[1]` to `r range_below_04bo[2]` over the range of catch levels considered. The probability of being below the candidate USR of $0.8B_{MSY}$ was from `r range_below_08bmsy[1]` to `r range_below_08bmsy[2]` over the range of catch levels considered. The probability of being below the candidate LRP of $0.2B_0$ was from `r range_below_02bo[1]` to `r range_below_02bo[2]` over the range of catch levels considered. The probability of being below the candidate LRP of $0.4B_{MSY}$ was zero for all catch levels considered.

All catch levels had a probability of greater than 0.5 of the `r proj_yr` biomass being under the $0.4B_0$ reference point. The lowest catch level having a probability of greater than 0.5 of the `r proj_yr` biomass being under the $0.2B_0$ limit reference point was `r row_greater_50_50_02bo$tac` t, with a probability of `r prob_greater_50_50_02bo`.

## SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY AND FUTURE RESEARCH

As with all stock assessments, there are two major types of uncertainty in the advice presented in this document:
1. Uncertainty in the estimates of model parameters within the assessment
2. Structural uncertainty arising from processes and data that were not included in the assessment
The first type, uncertainty within the assessment, is presented in terms of posterior credible intervals for parameters and state variables such as biomass, recruitment and fishing mortality. This uncertainty was captured in the decision tables and was further explored using sensitivity analyses.

The magnitude of catch and discards prior to 1996 is a major source of structural uncertainty in this assessment. As discussed in Section \@ref(sec:catch-data), all catch data prior to 1996 were omitted from this assessment on the recommendation of industry advisors and Technical Working Group, as was done in the `r la`. `r sp` is known to have been discarded at sea in large quantities due to proteolysis of the flesh if catches were not landed and frozen quickly after capture. Applications of ratio estimators or models to estimate historical discard rates were rejected as analytical tools due to discarding of whole tows and changes to discarding behaviour over time.

Stock structure of `r sp` is poorly understood in `r bc`. Several approaches are available to improve understanding of stock structure including genetic analysis, analysis of otolith microchemistry, and analysis of life-history traits such as growth and maturity. `r sp` is managed as a coast-wide stock. If there are distinct stocks within `r bc` waters, there may be risks associated with taking a large proportion of the TAC from one area. In particular, the more stable trend in the `r qcs` compared to the declines seen in the other survey indexes raises questions about stock structure.

The assessment model was able to fit all indices of abundance well with the possible exception of the `r qcs`. Although the index has declined since 2015 (and in particular in 2021 after the initial Technical Working Group meetings), the decline has been somewhat less pronounced then the other surveys or the `r dcpue`. We attempted to better fit the `r qcs` with survey-specific time-varying selectivity, but we were unable to obtain satisfactory MCMC diagnostics on this model and so used time-invariant selectivity as the base model. It is possible Queen Charlotte Sound represents a nursery ground for `r sp` or factors affecting local distribution or movement (such as environmental conditions) have resulted in a moderately different index pattern in `r qcs` compared to the other surveys. Overall, the congruence between the coast-wide 'stiched' survey and the `r dcpue` give us some confidence that both data sources are capturing underlying biomass dynamics.

There is a lack of age structures sampled from the commercial fleets from 2020 onwards. This would have had a minimal effect on this assessment given the last year of data was 2021. However, this may have an increasingly large impact on the assessment in terms of estimating selectivity, recruitment, and tracking age-cohorts within the composition data. Retrospective analyses could be conducted excluding existing commercial age data to partially evaluate this impact. Simulation analyses, possibly including closed-loop simulation, could also evaluate this impact. However, we think it is reasonable to assume that some level of continued age structure sampling from the commercial fleet will be important to this assessment going forward.

We suggest future research consider the use of the 'stitched' stock-wide geostatistical index as a replacement for considering each of the synoptic surveys as independent samples from the same overall stock (sometimes with different selectivities). The distinct age composition data precluded us from doing that in this assessment, but future research could consider the impact of considering these composition data as independent samples from the same overall stock (perhaps with area and density expansion) or standardizing these data as well with a similar multivariate geostatistical model.

Another area of future research will be how to incorporate environmental conditions into the stock advice more explicitly given the stock will eventually be batched into the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act*. It is not clear what mechanism this should entail for `r sp`, although options may include linking environmental indices to natural mortality or recruitment processes [e.g., @wham]. Other options would include adjusting target fishing mortality based on ecosystem modelling [@howell2021] or through closed-loop simulation that aims to find management procedures that our robust to uncertainties about future environmental conditions.
