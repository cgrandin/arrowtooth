## PROJECTIONS AND DECISION TABLE

Projections were run 3 years into the future with alternative constant catch levels ranging from `r f(min(base_model$proj$tac.vec * 1000))` to `r f(max(base_model$proj$tac.vec * 1000))` t in 1,000 t increments for the years `r assess_yr`--`r assess_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs - 1`. Projected, bias-corrected log recruitment anomalies in the years `r assess_yr`--`r assess_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs - 1` were drawn randomly from a normal distribution, $~N(0,\tau^2)$.

The projected trajectories (medians of the posteriors with 95% CI) are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-biomass-proj) and \@ref(fig:fig-rel-biomass-proj) for absolute spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass respectively. The uncertainty in the trajectory becomes larger the further into the future the projections are run, and as Figure \@ref(fig:fig-biomass-proj) shows, for the 10,000 t catch case spans from `r f(lo_uncert_2025_catch_10 * 1000)` t--`r f(hi_uncert_2025_catch_10 * 1000)` t, which represents a range of `r f(diff_uncert_2025_catch_10 * 1000)` t. The large amount of uncertainty should be taken into account when evaluating these projections.

Figures \@ref(fig:fig-catch-streams-nextyr-proj)--\@ref(fig:fig-catch-streams-nextnextnextyr-proj) show the medians of the posterior, 50% CI and 95% CI for the relative spawning biomass in the projected years, for each catch stream applied. The $B_0$-base reference points are also shown. These figures give another view of the medians and uncertainties shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-rel-biomass-proj), but with each figure representing one projected year only so that each posterior can be more clearly seen.

Posterior estimates of reference points and benchmarks are provided in Table \@ref(tab:reference-points-table). A decision table is presented showing predicted probabilities of undesirable states under the projected catch levels (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table)). An undesirable biomass-based performance measure is defined to occur when the `r proj_yr` projected  spawning biomass is below the reference point or benchmark, e.g. the ratio `r paste0('$B_{', proj_yr, '}/B_\mathrm{ReferencePoint} < 1$')`. Probabilities in the decision tables are measured as the proportion of posterior samples that meet the above criteria.

The base model decision table is presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-table). The model-predicted probability of the `r proj_yr` relative spawning biomass being below the `r assess_yr` relative spawning biomass ranged from `r prob_2023_2022_catch_0` under `r f(min(base_model$proj$tac.vec * 1000))` t of catch to `r prob_2023_2022_catch_15` under `r f(max(base_model$proj$tac.vec * 1000))` t of catch. The catch that is closest to 0.5 probability of the biomass declining from `r assess_yr` to `r proj_yr` while still being below 0.5 is `r f(catch_less_50_50 * 1000)` t, at a probability of `r val_less_50_50`.

The probability of being below the USR of $0.4B_0$ was from `r f(range_below_04bo[1], 3)` to `r f(range_below_04bo[2], 3)` over the range of catch levels considered; the probability of being below the LRP of $0.2B_0$ for the same catch range was from `r f(range_below_02bo[1], 3)` to `r f(range_below_02bo[2], 3)`.

All catch levels except zero had a probability of greater than 0.5 of the `r proj_yr` biomass being under the $0.4B_0$ reference point.

## SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY AND FUTURE RESEARCH

As with all stock assessments, there are two major types of uncertainty in the advice presented in this document:
1. Uncertainty in the estimates of model parameters within the assessment
2. Structural uncertainty arising from processes and data that were not included in the assessment

The first type, parameter uncertainty, is presented in terms of posterior credible intervals for parameters and state variables such as biomass, recruitment, and fishing mortality. This uncertainty was captured in the decision tables and was further explored using sensitivity analyses.

The magnitude of catch and discards prior to 1996 is a major source of structural uncertainty in this assessment. As discussed in Section \@ref(sec:catch-data), all catch data prior to 1996 were omitted from this assessment on the recommendation of industry advisors and Technical Working Group, as was done in the `r la`. `r sp` is known to have been discarded at sea in large quantities due to proteolysis of the flesh if catches were not landed and frozen quickly after capture. Applications of ratio estimators or models to estimate historical discard rates were rejected as analytical tools due to discarding of whole tows and changes to discarding behaviour over time.

Stock structure of `r sp` is poorly understood in `r bc`. Several approaches are available to improve understanding of stock structure including genetic analysis, analysis of otolith microchemistry, and analysis of life-history traits such as growth and maturity. `r sp` is managed as a coast-wide stock. If there are distinct stocks within `r bc` waters, there may be risks associated with taking a large proportion of the TAC from one area. In particular, the less steep decline in the `r qcs` compared to the declines seen in the other survey indexes raises questions about stock structure.

The assessment model was able to fit all indices of abundance well with the possible exception of the `r qcs`. Although the index has declined since 2015 (and in particular in 2021 after the initial Technical Working Group meetings), the decline has been somewhat less pronounced than the other surveys or the `r dcpue`. We attempted to better fit the `r qcs` with survey-specific time-varying selectivity, but we were unable to obtain satisfactory estimates of selectivity and MCMC diagnostics on this model and so used time-invariant selectivity in the base model. It is possible Queen Charlotte Sound represents a nursery ground for `r sp` or factors affecting local distribution or movement (such as environmental conditions) have resulted in a moderately different index pattern in the `r qcs` compared to the other surveys. Overall, the congruence between the coast-wide 'stitched' synoptic survey and the `r dcpue` give us some confidence that both data sources are capturing underlying biomass dynamics.

We suggest future research consider the use of the 'stitched' stock-wide geostatistical index as a replacement for considering each of the synoptic surveys as independent samples from the same overall stock (sometimes with different selectivities). The distinct age composition data precluded us from doing that in this assessment, but future research could consider the impact of considering these composition data as independent samples from the same overall stock (perhaps with area and density expansion) or standardizing these data as well with a similar multivariate geostatistical model.

There is a lack of age structures sampled from the commercial fleets from 2020 onwards. This would have had a minimal effect on this assessment given the last year of data was 2021. However, this may have an increasingly large impact on the assessment in terms of estimating selectivity, recruitment, and tracking age-cohorts within the composition data. Retrospective analyses could be conducted excluding existing commercial age data to partially evaluate this impact. Simulation analyses, possibly including closed-loop simulation, could also evaluate this impact. However, we think it is reasonable to assume that some level of continued age structure sampling from the commercial fleet will be important to this assessment going forward.

Taking into account the ecosystem considerations in Appendix \@ref(app:eco) and known biology of `r sp`, there are no clear indications that current environmental conditions should modify the catch advice in this assessment. Future research could evaluate incorporating environmental variables into the `r sp` stock advice more explicitly. It is not clear what mechanism this should entail, although options may include linking environmental indices to natural mortality or recruitment processes [e.g., @wham]. Other options would include adjusting target fishing mortality based on ecosystem modelling [@howell2021] or through closed-loop simulation that aims to find management procedures that are robust to uncertainties about future environmental conditions [e.g., @anderson2020gfmp].
  
Given the proximity of `r sp` spawning biomass to the LRP under the base model and most sensitivity analyses, as well as the declining survey indices, we suggest this stock assessment should be updated with new data on a relatively short interval. We suggest an appropriate interval would be two years once one additional survey will have been conducted for each subregion and new commercial biological samples will hopefully be available for aging.
