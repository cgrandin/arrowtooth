cat("# INTRODUCTION
`r sp` (*`r sp_science`*, Family `r sp_family`, also commonly called `r sp_colloq`), is a species of flatfish that occurs in the offshore waters of British Columbia (`r bc`). `r sp` are primarily taken by the groundfish bottom trawl fishery, although they are also encountered by hook and line fisheries, particularly those targeting Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*). Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers in the `r bc` groundfish fleet in the mid-2000s, most of the historical catch of `r sp` is understood to have been discarded at sea. Proteolysis occurs in the muscle tissue of this species a short time after it is caught, making the flesh mushy and unpalatable. In the past five years, Asian markets have been established for fillets that have been frozen at sea as soon as possible after capture to reduce proteolysis. There is also an Asian market for the frills. The stock was last assessed by @grandin2017, who presented an age-structured Bayesian model using the `r iscam` platform [@iscam]. This stock assessment covers the combined Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD and 5ABCDE off the west coast of `r bc`.")

`r sp` is managed as a coastwide stock in `r bc` with the majority of the catch coming from Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD; `r wcvi`, 5AB; `r qcs` and 5CD; `r hs` (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-catch-spatial) and \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-spatial), Table \@ref(tab:area-catch-table)). The Strait of Georgia (management area 4B) is not included in this stock assessment. The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) has been 5,000 t since February 21, 2020. The TAC was 15,000 t for many years prior to the reduction in 2020. February 21 is the start date for the `r sp` fishery each year.")

cat("## FISHERY AND MANAGEMENT HISTORY {#intro-management}
Prior to 2006 there were no limits on the amount of `r sp` that could be caught. In 2006 a TAC of 15,000 t was established and it remained at this level until 2017. In 2017 the TAC was increased to 17,500 t and remained there for two years until it was reduced to 14,000 t in 2019 as a precautionary measure to address concerns raised by the commercial trawl fleet about their oberved reduction in abundance of `r sp`. On January 30, 2020 GTAC recommended urgent, late changes to the 2020/21 Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) to address declining `r sp` abundance on traditional fishing grounds [@dfomemo2020]. These changes included:

- Reducing the 2020/21 TAC from 14,000 t to 5,000 t
- Reducing the 2019/20 quota carryover allowance from 30% to 10%
- Reducing the amount of temporary quota a licence can hold from 16% to 8% percent of the TAC
- Implementing new spatial closures from November 1 to March 31 to limit harvest of spawning aggregations

These management measures significantly limited the directed `r sp` fishery and were intended to facilitate non-targeted harvesting.

Before the TAC reduction to the IFMP in 2020, there was growing concern regarding the impact freezer trawlers were having on the ability of traditional wet boats (called Shoreside in this assessment) to access groundfish. Key `r sp` fishing grounds include waters near Brooks Peninsula, Cape St James, Rennell Sound, and Lax Kw'alaams. These waters are also key grounds for a number of other groundfish species. The Council of Lax Kw'alaams Band in particular have expressed concern about securing long term access to groundfish to support their local fish processing plant and had recently passed a resolution to ban freezer trawlers from fishing in their traditional territory around Prince Rupert. Furthermore, the North Coast Regional District and the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council had written to DFO expressing concerns about freezer trawlers and the vessels' effect on local groundfish access and processing capacity [@dfomemo2020].  

Both the Sport Fishing Advisory Board and the Halibut Advisory Board (HAB) have raised concerns about the level of Halibut bycatch associated with the `r sp` fishery, and commercial Halibut harvesters have expressed concern about the impacts freezer trawlers have had on their access to Halibut grounds south of Cape St James. Discussions between Groundfish Trawl Advisory Board (GTAC) and Halibut Advisory Board (HAB) representatives took place in 2020 to discuss additional spatial closures in an effort to avoid gear conflicts and minimize bycatch [@dfomemo2020].

### FISHERY MANAGEMENT IMPACTS ON CATCH AND REPORTING {#test-fishery}
A test fishery was opened in 2005 to determine marketability and economic viability of `r sp` for industry. The areas of high CPUE in the east area of Dixon Entrance seen in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-spatial) are mainly from this test fishery. The increased catch in 2005 can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch), especially in the northern areas; 5ABCDE. However, due to rapid proteolysis of the flesh, the fishery was not profitable and a large drop in catch is evident after 2005 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch)) when the test fishery ended abruptly.

The increase in catch seen from 2010--2014 was due to freezer trawlers joining the fleet (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch-fleet)). The freezer trawlers quickly overtook the Shoreside fleet and caught most of the total for every year since 2013. There has been an overall decline in annual catches since 2017, with a particularly large decrease occurring in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch)) and continuing through 2021. The large decrease is due to the quota reduction implemented by fisheries managers based on survey abundance index declines and reports of reduced availability of `r sp` on the fishing grounds (Section \@ref(intro-management)).

Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers, most of the historical catch of `r sp` is understood to have been discarded at sea in large quantities due to proteolysis of the flesh if catches were not landed and frozen quickly after capture. Before the introduction of 100% at-sea observer coverage in the `r bc` groundfish fleets in 1996, reporting of `r sp` discards in fishery logbooks was voluntary. Since `r sp` were not managed with quotas before 1996, there was little incentive for skippers to record discards accurately or at all. Therefore the quantity of discards in the pre-1996 period is highly uncertain and no catch reconstruction prior to 1996 could be made for this assessment.

Any foreign or U.S. catches were taken outside Canadian management zones and were not accounted for in this assessment.")
