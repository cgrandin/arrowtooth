cat("# INTRODUCTION
`r sp` (*`r sp_science`*, Family `r sp_family`, also commonly called `r sp_colloq`), is a species of flatfish that occurs in the offshore waters of British Columbia (`r bc`). `r sp` are primarily taken by the groundfish bottom trawl fishery, although they are also encountered by hook and line fisheries, particularly those targeting Pacific Halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*). Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers in the `r bc` groundfish fleet in the mid-2000s, most of the historical catch of `r sp` is understood to have been discarded at sea. Proteolysis occurs in the muscle tissue of this species a short time after it is caught, making the flesh mushy and unpalatable. In the past five years, markets have been established for fillets that have been frozen at sea as soon as possible after capture to reduce proteolysis. There is also a market for the frills. The stock was last assessed by @grandin2017, who presented an age-structured Bayesian model using the `r iscam` platform [@iscam]. This stock assessment covers the combined Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD and 5ABCDE off the west coast of `r bc`.")

cat("## PURPOSE OF DOCUMENT
`r sp` is managed as a coastwide stock in `r bc` with the majority of the catch coming from Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD; `r wcvi`, 5AB; `r qcs` and 5CD; `r hs` (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-catch-spatial) and \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-spatial), Table \@ref(tab:area-catch-table)). The Strait of Georgia (management area 4B) is not included in this stock assessment. The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) has been 5,000 t since February 21, 2020. The TAC was 15,000 t for many years prior to the reduction in 2020. February 21 is the start date for the groundfish trawl fishery each year.")

This assessment identifies reference points for `r sp` that are consistent with the DFO Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach [@dfo2009] and characterizes stock status relative to these reference points using a Bayesian, age-structured stock assessment model. Management advice is provided in the form of decision tables, which forecast the impacts of a range of harvest levels on `r sp` stock status relative to these reference points.")

`r sp` are distinguished by their large mouth and arrow-shaped teeth, for which the species is named. Their distribution ranges from Baja California to the eastern Bering Sea [@hart1973]. In `r bc`, the species inhabits depths from 50--900 m [@arf2001].")

cat("`r sp` exhibit sexual dimorphism. After sexual maturity, females grow faster than males and reach a larger maximum size (Appendix \@ref(app:bio-data-appendix), Figure \@ref(fig:fig-vb)). Theoretical maximum length, $L_{\infty}$, is estimated to be `r round(mat_fit$female[1], 1)` cm for females and `r round(mat_fit$male[1], 1)` cm for males in `r bc` although the maximum sizes that have been observed are `r round(max(filter(all_length_samples, sex == 2)$length, na.rm = T), 1)` cm for females and `r round(max(filter(all_length_samples, sex == 1)$length, na.rm = T), 1)` cm for males (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-lengths) and \@ref(fig:fig-vb)).

The maximum observed age is `r round(max(filter(all_age_samples, sex == 2)$age, na.rm = T), 1)` y for females and `r round(max(filter(all_age_samples, sex == 1)$age, na.rm = T), 1)` y for males.

cat("`r sp` are batch spawners with peak spawning occurring at depths deeper than 350 m in the fall and winter months, although the timing of spawning may vary inter-annually [@arf1995].

cat("## FISHERY AND MANAGEMENT HISTORY {#intro-management}
Prior to 2006 there were no limits on the amount of `r sp` that could be caught. In 2006 a TAC of 15,000 t was established and it remained at this level until 2017. In 2017, the TAC was increased to 17,500 t and remained there for two years until it was reduced to 14,000~t in 2019 as a precautionary measure to address concerns raised by the commercial trawl fleet about their oberved reduction in abundance of `r sp`. In 2020 the TAC was decreased to 5,000 t to address industry concerns regarding declining `r sp` abundance on traditional fishing grounds [@dfomemo2020].

### FISHERY MANAGEMENT IMPACTS ON CATCH AND REPORTING {#test-fishery}
The increase in catch seen from 2010--2014 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch)) was due to new market opportunities. There has been an overall decline in annual catches since 2017, with a particularly large decrease occurring in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch)) and continuing through 2021. The large decrease is due to the quota reduction which was based on survey abundance index and commercial CPUE declines.

Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers, most of the historical catch of `r sp` is understood to have been released at sea in unknown quantities due to proteolysis of the flesh if catches were not landed and frozen quickly after capture. Before the introduction of 100% at-sea observer coverage in the `r bc` groundfish fleets in 1996, reporting of `r sp` discards in fishery logbooks was mandatory, but since `r sp` were not given a TAC until 2005, there was little incentive for skippers to record discards accurately until at-sea observers were present aboard vessels starting in 1996. The quantity of discards in the pre-1996 period is highly uncertain and no catch reconstruction prior to 1996 could be made for this assessment.

U.S. and foreign catches were not accounted for in this assessment.")
