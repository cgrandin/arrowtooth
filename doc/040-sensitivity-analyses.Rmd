We tested sensitivity of the model outputs as follows:

1. Decrease $\sigma$  from `r base_sig` to `r sens_1_2_sig` (changes $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$) and estimate $\vartheta^2$
1. Increase initial value of $\tau$ from `r base_tau` to `r sens_1_3_tau` (changes $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$) and estimate $\vartheta^2$
1. Decrease initial value of $\tau$ from `r base_tau` to `r sens_1_4_tau` (changes $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$) and estimate $\vartheta^2$
1. Decrease mean, SD of $h$ prior from `r base_h_prior_params` to `r sens_1_5_h_prior_params`
1. Estimate $M_\mathrm{female}$ with a narrow prior (SD = `r sens_2_2_m_female$p2`)
1. Estimate $M_\mathrm{female}$ with a broad prior (SD = `r sens_2_3_m_female$p2`)
1. Estimate $M_\mathrm{male}$ with a narrow prior (SD = `r sens_2_4_m_male$p2`)
1. Estimate $M_\mathrm{male}$ with a broad prior (SD = `r sens_2_5_m_male$p2`)
1. Decrease mean of priors for catchabilities from `r base_qk_mean` to `r sens_qk_mean` ($q_k$ for all gears $k$)
1. Broader catchability priors, from SD = `r base_qk_sd` to `r sens_qkp_sd` ($q_k$ for all gears $k$)
1. Selectivity curves equal maturity ogive for all gears
1. Geostatistical model-based survey indices (Section \@ref(app:geostat))
1. Estimate time-varying selectivity for the `r qcs`, to try to improve the survey index fit

This list of sensitivity scenarios with more details is provided in Table \@ref(tab:sens-param-settings-table). Base model parameter settings are provided in Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table). All sensitivity models were run using MCMC with a chain length of `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, a sample frequency of `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)`, giving `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` samples, which were then burned in by `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` giving a total of `r f(mcmc_actual_samples)` samples retained for inference.

cat("### Decreasing $\sigma$ and adjusting $\tau$ {#sens-sigma}
`r iscam` uses an error parameterization which includes two parameters, $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$. They represent the total variance and the proportion of total variance associated with observation errors, respectively [@iscam]. Observation error SD ($\sigma$) and process error SD ($\tau$) cannot be estimated directly, instead there is a calculation done to translate those values to and from $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ (Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc), Eq. \@ref(eq:df17)). The values of $\sigma$ and $\tau$ were fixed in the base model [@grandin2017] at `r base_sig` and `r base_tau` respectively. By calculation, $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were fixed at `r f(base_vartheta$init, 2)` and `r f(base_rho$init, 4)`.

Reducing the observation error by decreasing $\sigma$ from `r base_sig` to `r sens_1_2_sig` and estimating $\vartheta^2$ increased the initial value of $\vartheta^2$ from `r f(base_vartheta$init, 2)` to `r f(sens_1_2_vartheta$init, 2)` while approximately halving $\rho$ from `r f(base_rho$init, 3)` to `r f(sens_1_2_rho$init, 3)`. The median and 95% CI of the posterior for $\vartheta^2$ was `r sens_1_2_vartheta$est`. There was little effect on the absolute biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance)), but the estimate of $B_0$ was increased from `r base_sbo[1]`,000 to `r svals[[1]][[2]]$sbo[1]`,000 t (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance)). The increase in the $B_0$ estimate caused a scaling downward of the relative biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-rel)). There were no substantial changes to the index fits, age fits, or selectivities. The posterior for $h$ was estimated higher, but with a much tighter distribution (`r sens_1_2_h$est`, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-prior-post)) compared to the base model (`r base_h$est`, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts)).

Setting the initial value for $\tau$ to `r sens_1_3_tau` had little effect on absolute biomass. For this value of $\tau$, the initial values of $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were `r f(sens_1_3_vartheta$init, 2)` and `r f(sens_1_3_rho$init, 3)` respectively (Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc), Eq. \@ref(eq:df17)). The estimate for $\vartheta^2$ was `r sens_1_3_vartheta$est`.

Setting the initial value for $\tau$ to `r sens_1_4_tau` also had little effect on absolute biomass. For this value of $\tau$, the initial values of $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were `r f(sens_1_4_vartheta$init, 2)` and `r f(sens_1_4_rho$init, 3)` respectively. The estimate for $\vartheta^2$ was `r sens_1_4_vartheta$est`.

The estimates of $B_0$ were increased for both of these models when compared to the base model, which resulted in scaling down of the relative biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-rel)). The increase of $B_0$ was much greater, and had a larger CI for the $\tau = 1.0$ model than the $\tau = 0.6$ model (`r sens_1_3_sbo$est` vs. `r sens_1_4_sbo$est`) 1000s of tonnes.

### Decreasing the mean of the steepness prior {#sens-h}

Decreasing the steepness prior mean from `r f(base_h_prior1, 2)` to `r f(sens_1_5_h_prior1, 2)` and changing the prior SD from `r f(base_h_prior2, 2)` to `r f(sens_1_5_h_prior2, 2)` produced little change in both absolute biomass and $B_0$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance)), despite having a different posterior (Figure \@ref(fig:sens-steepness-prior), compare to base model Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts)). The prior for $h$ is very influential on the posterior, but varying the $h$ prior in this way did not have a strong effect on the absolute or relative biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-rel)).

cat("### Modifying priors on $M_\mathrm{female}$ and $M_\mathrm{male}$ {#sens-m}
In the base model, the natural mortality parameters $M_\mathrm{female}$ and $M_\mathrm{male}$ are fixed to `r f(exp(base_m_female$init), 2)` and `r f(exp(base_m_male$init), 2)` respectively. Four sensitivity models were run, to estimate each $M$ parameter with broad and narrow prior SDs. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-m) shows the absolute biomass trajectories for these models. The relative spawning biomass trajectories are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-m-rel). Estimating $M_\mathrm{female}$ with narrow and broad priors produced estimates for $M_\mathrm{female}$ of `r sens_2_2_m_female$est` and `r sens_2_3_m_female$est` respectively. $M_\mathrm{male}$ remained fixed for those models, at `r f(exp(base_m_male$init), 2)`. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-m-rel) shows that the model is highly sensitive to the female natural mortality parameter, as both absolute biomass trajectories and $B_0$ estimates are inflated. The estimates are quite different from the fixed value of `r f(exp(base_m_female$init), 2)`, causing this scaling effect. If the female mortality is higher, the model must adjust the starting point higher in order to fit all parameters including the indices with the drop in biomass in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)).

The sensitivity models that estimate $M_\mathrm{male}$ with narrow and broad priors produced estimates of `r sens_2_4_m_male$est` and `r sens_2_5_m_male$est` respectively. These estimates were also substantially different than the fixed values of the parameter (`r f(exp(base_m_male$init), 2)`). However, males only make up `r f(1 - as.numeric(total_prop_female) / 100, 2)`% of the stock biomass and estimated male selectivity is much farther to the right of maturity than females (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)). This implies that males removed from the stock will have little impact, since there are not as many older male fish in the stock to be caught. The lack of older males can be seen in the length and age data (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-lengths) and \@ref(fig:fig-ages)).

This model is clearly sensitive to the values chosen or estimated for natural mortality. The base model uses fixed values as used by several nearby jurisdictions [@goa2017; @goa2019; @bering2019; @goa2020; @goa2021].

cat("### Modifying catchability priors {#sens-q}
The catchability parameters are $\operatorname{ln}(q_k)$ where $k$ is the gear, one for each trawl fleet and survey index (`r paste(base_model$dat$gear_names, collapse = ', ')`). These parameters have an associated normal prior with a log mean and SD set in the `r iscam` control files. In the base model those are `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(base_qk_mean, 1), ')$')` and `r f(base_qk_sd, 1)`, respectively.

Two sensitivity models were run to test the influence of the priors for $\operatorname{ln}(q_k)$. In the first, the means for all gears were increased from `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(base_qk_mean, 1), ')$')` to `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(sens_qk_mean, 1), ')$')`, and the SD remained at `r base_qk_sd`. In the second, the prior was broadened by setting the SD for all the gears to `r sens_qkp_sd`. The means for that model remained at `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(base_qk_mean, 1), ')$')`.

The absolute and relative biomass was almost identical to the base model for the second sensitivity model, where the SDs were modified, but increasing the mean resulted in a lower estimate of $B_0$, and therefore a higher relative biomass overall.

The catchability estimates in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-q-q) show that the median estimate of $q$ for the `r qcs` for the model in which the mean was increased was very large (`r f(unlist(as_tibble(models$sens_grps[[3]][[2]]$mcmccalcs$q_quants)[2, 1]), 3)`).

The large estimate of $q$ for the increased mean model is reflected in the index fit for the `r qcs` (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-q-index)). The index fit is arguably better overall than the base model, but at the cost of an unreasonable $q$ and female selectivity (`r sens_3_2_selex_f_qcs_mean_ci`) estimate.

cat("### Setting selectivities equal to maturity {#sens-sel-mat}
This sensitivity came about in the `r la` cycle, where it was found that the estimated selectivity curves were all to the right of the maturity ogive [Figure 17, @grandin2017]. This caused the value of $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ to be very large and essentially give the advice that an unlimited amount of catch could be taken without affecting the stock. We repeat it here, as the same situation has arisen with the current base model and to compare this model with the single sex model from the `r la`.

For this model structure, the absolute biomass and $B_0$ estimates are much larger than for the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex)). The median of the posterior for $B_0$ was estimated to be `r svals[[4]][[2]]$sbo[1]`,000 t with a broad CI of `r svals[[4]][[2]]$sbo[2]`. For comparison, the base model had a $B_0$ estimate of `r base_sbo[1]`,000 t with a CI of `r base_sbo[2]` 1000s of tonnes. The absolute biomass trajectory is also high, so the relative biomass is higher than the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-rel)). The index fits all reflect this, as they all show a one-way trip downwards (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-index-fits)). This model shows a high degree of autocorrelation in MCMC samples for almost all parameters: Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-sel-eq-mat-autocor) shows the estimated non-selectivity parameters and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-sel-eq-mat-autocor-sel) shows the estimated selectivity parameters. Due to this high autocorrelation, we did proceed further with this analysis.

cat("### Using TV selectivity for the `r qcs` {#sens-qcs-tv}
In an attempt to improve the fit of the `r qcs` index (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)), we implemented time-varying selectivity in `r iscam` and ran the model with the `r qcs` having three blocks of selectivity, 2003--2010, 2011--2016, and 2017--2021. We tried many combinations of both number of selectivity blocks and range of each block and this particular combination fit the data the best.

The absolute and relative biomasss trajectories only had small differences when compared to the base model (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex) and \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-rel)). The biomass in the final year was a little lower than that of the base model. The index fit was better overall than for the base model, especially in the latter part of the series (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-index-fits)). This came at the expense of a poor estimate of selectivity. The selectivity estimates for the three-year blocks can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-tv). The selectivity curves for the early years (left panel) are far to the right for both sexes---much further than the overall selectivities in the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)). The last block of years (2017--2021, right panel) are comparable to the overall selectivity for the `r qcs` in the base model. The intermediate years (2010--2016, middle panel) have unreasonable selectivity estimates, with the medians and the low CI (2.5%) being equal and estimated at 0.5. A bound was hit for the selectivity in these years, which makes this model questionable.

There is also substantial autocorrelation in the MCMC samples for this model (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-autocor-tv) and \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-autocor-sel-tv)) and the trace plots are not adequate for valid inference (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-trace-tv) and \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-trace-sel-tv)).

This sensitivity involved replacing the index data for the three synoptic surveys: (`r qcs`, `r hss`, and `r wcvis`). These data are calculated using a standard design-based estimator in the base model. Here, they were replaced with geostatistical-based indices (Appendix \@ref(app:geostat)).

The index fit is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-geostat-index-fits). The index points here are a different index than the base model, so the base model is not plotted against it. The fit to the index is about equivalent to the fit to the index in the base model.
