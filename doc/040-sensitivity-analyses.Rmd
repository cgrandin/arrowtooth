This list of sensitivity scenarios with more details is provided in Table \@ref(tab:sens-param-settings-table). Base model parameter settings are provided in Table \@ref(tab:param-settings-table). All sensitivity models were run using MCMC with a chain length of `r f(mcmc_chain_length)`, a sample frequency of `r f(mcmc_sample_freq)`, giving `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` samples, which were then burned in by `r f(mcmc_burn_in)` giving a total of `r f(mcmc_actual_samples)` samples retained for inference.

cat("### Decreasing $\sigma$ and adjusting $\tau$ {#sens-sigma}
`r iscam` uses an error parameterization which includes two parameters, $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$. They represent the total variance and the proportion of total variance associated with observation errors, respectively [@iscam]. Observation error SD ($\sigma$) and process error SD ($\tau$) cannot be estimated directly, instead there is a calculation done to translate those values to and from $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ (Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc), Eq. \@ref(eq:df17)). The values of $\sigma$ and $\tau$ were fixed in the base model [@grandin2017] at `r base_sig` and `r base_tau` respectively. By calculation, $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were fixed at `r f(base_vartheta$init, 2)` and `r f(base_rho$init, 4)`.

Reducing the observation error by decreasing $\sigma$ from `r base_sig` to `r sens_1_2_sig` and estimating $\vartheta^2$ increased the initial value of $\vartheta^2$ from `r f(base_vartheta$init, 2)` to `r f(sens_1_2_vartheta$init, 2)` while approximately halving $\rho$ from `r f(base_rho$init, 3)` to `r f(sens_1_2_rho$init, 3)`. The median and 95% CI of the posterior for $\vartheta^2$ was `r sens_1_2_vartheta$est`. There was little effect on the absolute biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance)), but the estimate of $B_0$ was increased from `r f(as.numeric(base_sbo[1]) * 1000)`, to `r svals[[1]][[2]]$sbo[1]`,000 t (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance)). The increase in the $B_0$ estimate caused a scaling downward of the relative biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-rel)). There were no substantial changes to the index fits, age fits, or selectivities.

Setting the initial value for $\tau$ to `r sens_1_3_tau` had little effect on absolute biomass. For this value of $\tau$, the initial values of $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were `r f(sens_1_3_vartheta$init, 2)` and `r f(sens_1_3_rho$init, 3)` respectively (Appendix \@ref(app:model-desc), Eq. \@ref(eq:df17)). The estimate for $\vartheta^2$ was `r sens_1_3_vartheta$est`.

Setting the initial value for $\tau$ to `r sens_1_4_tau` also had little effect on absolute biomass. For this value of $\tau$, the initial values of $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were `r f(sens_1_4_vartheta$init, 2)` and `r f(sens_1_4_rho$init, 3)` respectively. The estimate for $\vartheta^2$ was `r sens_1_4_vartheta$est`.

The estimates of $B_0$ were increased for both of these models when compared to the base model, which resulted in scaling down of the relative biomass trajectory (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-rel)). The increase of $B_0$ was much greater, and had a larger CI for the $\tau = 1.0$ model than the $\tau = 0.6$ model (`r sens_1_3_sbo$est` vs. `r sens_1_4_sbo$est`) thousand tonnes.

### Decreasing the mean of the steepness prior {#sens-h}

Decreasing the steepness prior mean from `r f(base_h_prior1, 2)` to `r f(sens_1_5_h_prior1, 2)` and changing the prior SD from `r f(base_h_prior2, 2)` to `r f(sens_1_5_h_prior2, 2)` produced little change in both absolute biomass and $B_0$ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance)), despite having a different posterior (Figure \@ref(fig:sens-steepness-prior), compare to base model Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-priors-posts)). The prior for $h$ is very influential on the posterior, but the value of $h$ does not have a large effect on the absolute or relative biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-variance-rel)).

cat("### Modifying priors on $M_\mathrm{female}$ and $M_\mathrm{male}$ {#sens-m}
In the base model, the natural mortality parameters $M_\mathrm{female}$ and $M_\mathrm{male}$ are fixed to `r f(exp(base_m_female$init), 2)` and `r f(exp(base_m_male$init), 2)` respectively. Four sensitivity models were run, to estimate each $M$ parameter with broad and narrow prior SDs. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-m) shows the absolute biomass trajectories for these models. The relative spawning biomass trajectories are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-m-rel). Estimating $M_\mathrm{female}$ with narrow and broad priors produced estimates for $M_\mathrm{female}$ of `r sens_2_2_m_female$est` and `r sens_2_3_m_female$est` respectively. $M_\mathrm{male}$ remained fixed for those models, at `r f(exp(base_m_male$init), 2)`. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-m) shows that the model is sensitive to the female natural mortality parameter, as both absolute biomass trajectories and $B_0$ estimates are inflated. The estimates are quite different from the fixed value of `r f(exp(base_m_female$init), 2)`, causing this scaling effect. If the female mortality is higher, the model must adjust the starting point ($B_0$) higher in order to fit all parameters including the indices with the drop in biomass in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)).

The sensitivity models that estimate $M_\mathrm{male}$ with narrow and broad priors produced estimates of `r sens_2_4_m_male$est` and `r sens_2_5_m_male$est` respectively. These estimates were also substantially different than the fixed values of the parameter (`r f(exp(base_m_male$init), 2)`). However, males only make up `r f((1 - as.numeric(total_prop_female)) * 100)`% of the spawning stock biomass and estimated male selectivity is generally farther to the right of maturity than females (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)). This implies that males removed from the stock will have lower overall impact to the stock biomass, since there are not as many older male fish in the stock to be caught, and the selectivity is higher on those fewer fish. The lack of older males can be seen in the length and age data (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-lengths) and \@ref(fig:fig-ages)).

This model is sensitive to natural mortality values whether fixed or estimated. The base model uses fixed values as used by several nearby jurisdictions [@goa2017; @goa2019; @bering2019; @goa2020; @goa2021].

cat("### Modifying catchability priors {#sens-q}
The catchability parameters are $\operatorname{ln}(q_k)$ where $k$ is the gear, one for each trawl fleet and survey index (`r paste(base_model$dat$gear_names, collapse = ', ')`). These parameters have an associated normal prior with a log mean and SD set in the `r iscam` control files. In the base model those are `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(base_qk_mean, 1), ')$')` and `r paste0('$', f(base_qk_sd, 1), '$')`, respectively.

Two sensitivity models were run to test the influence of the priors for $\operatorname{ln}(q_k)$. In the first, the means for all gears were increased from `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(base_qk_mean, 1), ')$')` to `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(sens_qk_mean, 1), ')$')`, and the SD remained at `r paste0('$', f(base_qk_sd, 1), '$')`. In the second, the prior was broadened by setting the SD for all the gears to `r paste0('$', f(base_qk_sd, 1), '$')`. The means for that model remained at `r paste0('$\operatorname{ln}(', f(base_qk_mean, 1), ')$')`.

The absolute and relative biomass was almost identical to the base model for these models (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-sens-q-m) and \@ref(fig:fig-sens-q-rel)). The catchability estimates were also almost identical between these models and the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-q-q)).

cat("### Setting selectivities equal to maturity {#sens-sel-mat}
This sensitivity came about in the `r la` cycle, where it was found that the estimated selectivity curves were all to the right of the maturity ogive [Figure 17, @grandin2017]. This caused the value of $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ to be very large and essentially give the advice that an unlimited amount of catch could be taken without affecting the stock. We repeat it here, as the same situation has arisen with the current base model and to compare this model with the single sex model from the `r la`.

For this model structure, the absolute biomass and $B_0$ estimates are much larger than for the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex)). The median of the posterior for $B_0$ was estimated to be `r f(as.numeric(svals[[4]][[2]]$sbo[1]) * 1000)` t with a broad CI of `r svals[[4]][[2]]$sbo[2]` thousand t. For comparison, the base model had a $B_0$ estimate of `r f(as.numeric(base_sbo[1]) * 1000)` t with a CI of `r base_sbo[2]` thousand t. The absolute biomass trajectory is also high, so the relative biomass is higher than the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-rel)). The index fits all reflect this, as they all show a one-way trip downwards (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-index-fits)).

The vulnerable biomass for this model is substantially higher than for the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-sel-eq-mat-vuln)), and exactly equal for the two fleets (one is overlapping the other and we cannnot see it in the figure). This is due to selectivity being exactly the same for both fleets, not because they are equal to the maturity. The ratio of the sum of the two fleets' vulnerable biomasses to the spawning biomass is `r f(sel_eq_mat_vuln_ratio, 2)`. For the base model, this ratio is `r f(base_model_vuln_ratio, 2)`. Moving the selectivity to the left increases the vulnerable biomass relative to the spawning biomass.

cat("### Using TV selectivity for the `r qcs` {#sens-qcs-tv}
In an attempt to improve the fit of the `r qcs` index (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits)), we implemented time-varying selectivity in `r iscam` and ran the model with the `r qcs` having three blocks of selectivity, 2003--2010, 2011--2016, and 2017--2021. We tried many combinations of both number of selectivity blocks and range of each block and this particular combination fit the data the best.

The absolute and relative biomasss trajectories both show a lower value in 2022 than the base model (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex) and \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-rel)). The index fit was better overall than for the base model, especially in the latter part of the series (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-selex-index-fits)). The improved fit to the QCS index was the goal of this model run but came at the expense of poor estimates of selectivity. The selectivity estimates for the three-year blocks can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-tv). The male selectivity for the early years (left panel) is far to the right, much further than the time-invariant selectivities in the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mcmc-selex)). The other two time periods have even more unreasonable estimates of selectivity, making this model unusable for any form of advice.

There was also some autocorrelation in the MCMC samples for the `r qcs` selectivity parameters in this model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-autocor-sel)) and the trace plots for those parameters are not adequate for valid inference (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-qcs-trace-sel-tv)).
