`r sp` (*`r sp_science`*) stock status on the West Coast of `r bc` was assessed using data from 1996--2021 and examined at a CSAS review meeting on October 19 and 20, 2022. The biomass of this stock has been declining since 2012, and an assessment was requested by the Pacific Groundfish Management Unit (GMU) in 2022. In the `r ca`, the stock was estimated slightly below the Upper Stock Reference (USR) in the base model and close to the Limit Reference Point (LRP) under one sensitivity model with higher recruitment variation. The model also showed declining estimated spawning stock biomass, declining survey indices, and declining estimated recruitment. Due to all of these issues, a two-year update on the stock was requested by the GMU. Two years was chosen because it it a relatively short amount of time, but long enough that all of the surveys included in the model would have another data point added to their indices.

The `r ca` estimated a median stock size at the beginning of 2022 (or end of 2021) of 67.95 kilotonnes (kt) with a credible interval of 56.14--83.83 kt. When divided by the estimated unfished biomass ($B_0$), the median relative biomass for 2022 was estimated to be 0.37 with a credible interval of 0.26--0.51. The estimated median relative biomass for 2011, was estimated to be 0.77 with a credible interval of 0.53--1.09. The estimated biomass declined each year from 2011--2021.

A summary of the `r ca` can be found in the [Science Advisory Report 2023/042](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/SAR-AS/2023/2023_042-eng.html).
