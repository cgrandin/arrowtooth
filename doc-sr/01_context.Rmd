`r sp` (*`r sp_science`*) stock status on the West Coast of `r bc` was assessed using data from 1996--2021 and examined at a CSAS review meeting on October 19 and 20, 2022.

The model used to assess this stock was the Inegrated Statistic Catch-at-Age Model (`r iscam`) and was tuned to five fishery-independent trawl survey series covering `r start_catch_yr`--2021. In addition, a Discard CPUE series was used as an index of abundance. This series was created using discards from fishery trawl catch as a proxy for CPUE.

A two-sex, two-fleet base model was selected and implemented in a Bayesian context using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

The 2021 assessment estimated a median stock size at the beginning of 2022 of 67.95 kilotonnes (kt) with a credible interval of 56.14--83.83 kt. When divided by the estimated initial or virgin biomass ($B_0$), the median relative biomass for 2022 was estimated to be 0.37 with a credible interval of 0.26--0.51. The esimated median relative biomass for 2011 (10 years prior), was estimated to be 0.77 with a credible interval of 0.53--0.1.09. The estimated biomass declined each year from 2011--2021.

A summary of the 2021 stock assessment can be found in the [Science Advisory Report 2023/042](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/SAR-AS/2023/2023_042-eng.html).
