cat("## Ecosystem Considerations

There has not been any additional work done in ecosystem-based science for `r sp` in the two years since the `r ca `, although continuation of the body condition work (Appendices E and F, `r ca`) may be useful and will be revisited in the next stock assessment update.

A winter survey is planned for 2026 to sample several species, including `r sp`. Spawning and hatching are known to occur in winter [@arf1995; @blood2007], and analyzing maturities at that stage may give a better understanding of the maturity ogive and it's apparent shift to the right of selectivity.
