The `r iscam` model used in this update had the same structure and assumptions as the model used in the `r ca`. New data added were commercial catch for 2022 and 2023, new survey index points, and new Discard CPUE index points. The growth parameters, estimated outside the `r iscam` framework, changed by a very small amount, which did not affect the model estimates.

With the addition of the new data, the relative spawning biomass trajectory from `r start_catch_yr`--2021 remained largely unchanged from the `r ca`, although the initial biomass, $B_0$, and the absolute spawning biomass values were estimated to be slightly lower in this update than in the `r ca`.

There were no large changes in fits to any index points in the four survey indices and the `r dcpue`. Three of the synoptic survey indices had one new index point added each (the `r hsmas` has a terminal year of 2003 and was not updated), and the `r dcpue` had two new index points added (2022 and 2023) since it is based on commercial catch.

The projections show medians and credible intervals for catches of 1 to 8 kt, in 1 kt increments (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-rel-biomass-proj) and \@ref(fig:fig-rel-biomass-proj-closeup)). The figure shows that for catch values of 1--6 kt the median of projected biomass is expected to increase to 2027. For catch values of 7--8 kt the median of projected biomass is expected to remain flat, and remain below the USR of $0.4B_0$.

Recruitment in the last four years of the model is estimated with a large degree of uncertainty (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-recr)). This is due to the lack of new ages being included in the model for 2022 and 2023. We expect new age composition data to be available for the next update to this assessment.

There are several harvest decision tables provided in this document (Tables \@ref(tab:decision-table-02bo)--\@ref(tab:decision-table-decreasing-biomass)) which, for 8 different catch levels from 1 kt to 8 kt, give the probabilities of the projected relative biomass being above:

1. the LRP of $0.2B_0$ (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-02bo)),
2. the alternative USR of $0.35B_0$ (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-035bo)),
3. the USR of $0.4B_0$ (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-04bo)), and
4. the previous year's biomass (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-decreasing-biomass)).

Some observations from the decision tables:

1. The probability of being above the LRP of $0.2B_0$ at the beginning of 2025 is 0.99 if the highest catch level of 8 kt is caught in 2024 (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-02bo)),

2. The probability of being above the LRP of $0.2B_0$ at the beginning of 2027 is 0.98 if the highest catch level of 8 kt is caught each year from `r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs` (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-02bo)),

3. The probability of being above the alternative candidate USR of $0.35B_0$ at the beginning of 2025 is 0.61 if the highest catch level of 8 kt is caught in 2024 (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-035bo)),

4. The probability of being above the alternative candidate USR of $0.35B_0$ at the beginning of 2027 is 0.60 if the highest catch level of 8 kt is caught each year from `r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs` (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-035bo)),

5. The probability of being above the candidate USR of $0.4B_0$ at the beginning of 2025 is 0.37 if the highest catch level of 8 kt is caught in 2024 (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-04bo)),

6. The probability of being above the candidate USR of $0.4B_0$ at the beginning of 2027 is 0.42 if the highest catch level of 8 kt is caught each year from `r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs` (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-04bo)),

7. A probability of 0.5 of being above the candidate USR of $0.4B_0$ at the beginning of 2025 occurs between 2 and 4 kt of catch in 2024. A higher catch will result in the probability being less than 0.5 (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-04bo)),

8. A probability of 0.5 of being above the candidate USR of $0.4B_0$ at the beginning of 2027 occurs between 4 and 5 kt of constant catch for each year from `r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs`. A higher constant catch will result in the probability being less than 0.5 (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-decreasing-biomass)), and

9. A probability of 0.5 of biomass increasing year-to-year for each year from `r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + base_model$proj$num.projyrs` occurs between 7 and 8 kt of constant catch in each year (Table \@ref(tab:decision-table-decreasing-biomass)).

This stock should be reviewed once again in three years, in September or October 2027 as a Science Response. In addition to new catch and survey index data, that update model must have new age data included for the three synoptic surveys and both fleets in the commercial fishery for the time period 2022-2026.
