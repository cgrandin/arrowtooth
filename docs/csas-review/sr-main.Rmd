### Introduction

.left[
**`r sp`**
- are a flatfish that occurs in the offshore waters of `r bc`;
- mostly feed on Capelin, Euphausiids, Walleye Pollock, Pandalid shrimp, Herring, and other forage fish;
- are prey for mostly Pacific Cod, Pacific Halibut, and Steller sea lions; for juveniles, adult `r sp` and Walleye Pollock;
- are primarily caught by bottom trawl fishery, and sometimes by hook and line in the Halibut fishery;
- must be frozen shortly after catching due to proteolysis of the flesh;
- seasonal vertical migration to deeper water in winter, shallower in summer; and
- spawn and hatch in deeper water (>350m), in winter.
- were first assessed in 2015 ([Research Document](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2017/2017_025-eng.html))

**The last (2022) assessment model**
- includes data from 1996-2021,
- includes 3 synoptic surveys (QCS, HS, and WCVI),
- includes a `r dcpue`, which tracks discards in the commercial fleets,
- is split by sex, and has two commercial trawl fleets (Freezer trawlers and Shoreside).

### Management History

.left[
- Are managed as a coastwide stock the TAC is a coastwide amount to be shared by all fleets.
- There were no limits on catch prior to 2006.
- A TAC of 15 kt was in place from 2006-2017.
- The TAC increased to 17.5 kt in 2017.
- The TAC decreased to 14 kt in 2019.
- In January 2020 late changes to the IFMP to address declining abundance in the synoptic surveys were recommended. These changes included:
  - reducing 2019/2020 carryover allowance from 30% to 10%,
  - reducing 2020/2021 TAC from 14 kt to 5 kt,
  - reducing the amount of temporary quota a license can hold from 16% to 8% of TAC, and
  - implementing new spatial closures from November 1 to March 31 to limit harvesting of spawning aggregations.
- The TAC was reduced further to 4kt after the 2022 assessment was completed and remains there.
- Closures in 2024 were implemented to protect spawning aggregations of `r sp`:
  - Rennell Sound (November 15, 2024 -- January 15, 2025)
  - Turtleback/Cape Cook (October 15, 2024 -- December 31, 2024)
  - 800 Line/Circle Tow (November 15, 2024 -- March 31, 2025 )

### Catch

.left[

- There was no discard reporting prior to 1996, when observers were introduced. Entire tows were often discarded without report. Because of this, a historical catch reconstruction was not attempted.

- `r sp` continued to be discarded at sea in great numbers until the arrival of Freezer Trawlers in the mid 2000's, which could freeze their catch at sea and avoid proteolysis.

- There have been large declines recently (2020-2023) which correspond to TAC reductions.

- The catch has been dominated by Freezer Trawlers from 2010--2023.

- The commercial fishing year for `r sp` starts on Feb 21 and ends on Feb 20. All yearly catch data in this assessment were aggregated in this way.

- The catch (landings + discards) for the Freezer Trawler fleet increased by `r perc_inc_ft_2021_2022`% from 2021 to 2022, but then decreased by `r perc_dec_ft_2022_2023`% from 2022 to 2023. The Shoreside fleet decreased for both years, by `r perc_dec_ss_2021_2022`% from 2021 to 2022, and by `r perc_dec_ss_2022_2023`% from 2022 to 2023.

### Stock Assessment Model
.left[
- no changes to the 2022 parameterization,

- includes catch data from `r start_catch_yr`--`r end_catch_yr`,

- includes ages from `r start_catch_yr`-- 2021 (no new ages),

- very small change in growth parameters from the `r ca`,

- includes 3 synoptic surveys (QCS, HS, and WCVI),

- includes a `r dcpue`, which tracks discards in the commercial fleets,

- is split by sex, and has two commercial trawl fleets (Freezer trawlers and Shoreside).

- M fixed at 0.2 for Females and 0.35 for Males

- all parameter estimates were very close to those in Table 6 of the `r ca`

- median posterior for $B_0$ decreased from 184.16 in `r ca` to `r f(median(base_model$mcmccalcs$params$sbo), 2)`

- the median posterior biomass estimates were also slightly less than the estimates in the `r ca`, so there was not much scaling effect in the relative biomass

### Index fits

.left[

- One new index point added for each of the 3 Synoptic surveys:
  - 2022 for the `r wcviss`,
  - 2023 for the `r qcsss` and the `r hsss`,

- Two new index points for the `r dcpue`, 2022 and 2023.

- `r dcpue` values for all years changed from the `r ca` because they are fit by a GLMM (light grey points in Figure 5).

- The 2022 point for the `r dcpue` and the 2023 point for the `r qcsss` were not fit well, but the medians were within the uncertainty.

- The slight increase in the survey indices in 2023 are driving the increase in estimated biomass for the beginning of 2024.

### Length data

.left[

- sex-specific lengths continue to be recorded for surveys, and show that the population is made up of a greater proportion of larger females than males.
 
- no length sampling since 2019 for the Shoreside fleet.
 
- Small number of length samples in 2020 in the Freezer Trawler fleet, then none until 2023 when the new at-sea sampling started (bags of fish frozen at sea and sampled on shore)
 
- Survey data show larger females make up more of the samples than males.
 
- In 2023, the Freezer Trawler fleet sampled more males than females, or at least male length distribution was tighter than females.

### MCMC Diagnostics

- Traceplots appear stable, without artifacts, as in the `r ca`.

- There is very little autocorrelation in the parameters.

- Catchability parameters show more correlation with each other in this update than in the `r ca`, this is mostly evident in the catchability for the `r qcsss` and the `r hsss` parameters (q1 and q3).

- The pairs plot is Figure 41 in the `r ca`.

### Catch Projections and Decision Tables

.left[

- DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF) reference points could not be used (MSY-based), as the selectivity estimates included non-mature fish which appeared to make the entire stock vulnerable to the stock.

- The LRP is $0.2B_0$, the USR is $0.4B_0$, and the alternative USR $0.35B_0$.

- The catch levels projected were truncated at Fishery management's request to 1kt to 8kt in 1kt increments. In the `r ca`, they were from 1kt to 15kt.

- Decision tables are also opposite of the ones in the `r ca`, as all of the probabilities are of being ***above*** the reference points instead of below.
