The Arrowtooth Flounder assessment project is based entirely inside GitHub.

The pages here contain links to resources which include links to the CSAS documents: Research documents (ResDoc), Science Advisory Reports (SAR), and Science Responses (SR) and slides used to present those documents at review meetings.
